						<span>"Now do ye off your helmets," quoth Hagen, the bold knight,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>"For I and my companion will guard ye all aright.</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>And should the men of Etzel a fresh attack essay,</span>

					<span>
						<span>So will I warn my masters with all the speed I may."</span>

						<span>The head was then uncover'd of many a warrior good;</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>They sat upon the fallen, who lay there steep'd in blood,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>And had to death been smitten so lately by their hand.</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>By many evil glances the noble guests were scann'd.</span>

						<span>Before the fall of evening the king his measures took,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>The queen thereto assenting,—that with some better luck</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>The Hunnish knights might venture. Full twenty thousand men</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Were seen before him standing: to battle must they, then.</span>

						<span>Thereon with furious onslaught the strangers were attack'd.</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>And Dankwart, Hagen's brother, a man right swift to act,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Sprang from his lords, the foemen before the door to rout;—</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>It seem'd that he must perish, but safely gat he out.</span>

						<span>The deadly struggle lasted till stay'd it was by night.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>As well became good heroes, the guests maintained the fight</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Against the men of Etzel one whole long summer day.</span>

					<span>
						<span>Whereby the Dame Kriemhilda avenged her heart-ache well</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Upon her nearest kinsfolk and many another wight.</span>

						<span>The day for them was ended in great anxiety.</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>It seem'd to them 'twere better a speedy death to die,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Than linger there, awaiting some dread, unheard-of pain.</span>
					</span>
					<br/>

						<span>The king, by word, besought they to come unto them there.</span>

					<span>
						<span>These heroes, blood-bespatter'd and soil'd with armour-wear,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>From out the palace follow'd the noble kings all three;</span>
					</span>

						<span>Both Etzel and Kriemhilda came thither them before.</span>

					<span>
						<span>The land was their possession: their host grew more and more.</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>The king spake to the strangers: " Say, what will ye of me?</span>

					<br/>
					<span>

					<span>
						<span>My child, that ye have slain me, and many of my kin.</span>

					<span>
						<span>My people all were lying before thy heroes dead</span>

						<span>Thereon, in wrathful humour, Gunther the warrior spake:</span>

					<span>

					<span>
						<span>That they outside the palace be granted leave to go.</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>But when Kriemhilda heard it, sorely aggrieved was she.</span>

					<span>
						<span>Whoe'er by thirst is troubled may quench it here with blood.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>And then he fell to drinking the oozing stream of blood;</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Unused as he was to it, he thought it passing good.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>A better wine right seldom hath been pour'd out for me.</span>

					<span>
						<span>Then were there many others who also drank the blood.</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Thereby each one among them began to gain new life—</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>In dear ones it was paid for by many a goodly wife.</span>

						<span>Within the hall about them the sparks fell thick around,</span>

					<span>
						<span>Upon their shields they caught them and turn'd them to the ground.</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>The fire and smoke together distress'd them terribly.</span>

					<span>
						<span>Now grant us, God of Heaven, on better times to fall!</span>

					<span>

					<span>
						<span>By dint of all their labours, or by the fiery pain;</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Yet still of them were living six hundred gallant wights,</span>

						<span>A dire assault of battle -. in straits the heroes were.</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Though thickly all amongst them stout javelins were thrown.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Moreover they were eager to do the king's command.</span>

					<span>
