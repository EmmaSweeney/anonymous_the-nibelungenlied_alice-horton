						<span>He fell to bitter weeping; sad was the hero's strait:</span>

					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>"Woe for my trusty helpmate who now is lost to me!</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<span>Ay! of King Etzel's liegeman the like I ne'er shall see.</span>

					<span>
						<span>Which of the warriors was it who him so foully slew? "</span>

					<span>
						<span>"That did the stalwart Gernot by strength of arm," he said:</span>

					<span>
						<span>That they must straightway arm them, for thither will I go;</span>
					</span>

					<span>
