			<h2>ADVENTURE XII.— HOW GUNTHER BADE SIEGFRIED TO THE FESTIVAL.</h2>

724. 
Now Gunther's wife the meanwhile was brooding ev'ry day : 
" Why bears herself Dame Kriemhild in such a lofty way ? 
Is not her husband Siegfried a vassal of our own ? 
Scant service hath he paid us in all these years agone ! " 

725. 
Within her heart this kept she, and heed took thereanent. 
Yet that they came not ever did make her ill-content, 
And that she got no service out of Sir Siegfried's land ; 
And wherefore this should happen she fain would understand. 

726. 
So of the king inquired she, whether it might not be 
That she the Lady Kriemhild yet once again might see? 
She privily spoke to him of what her mind thus teased : 
But when her lord had heard her, he was but half well-pleased. 

727. 
"And how are we to bring them," then said the mighty king, 
" Here into this our country ? that were no easy thing ! 
Too far from us they're dwelling ; to ask I am afraid." 
Then answer'd him Brunhilda, with crafty air and said : 

728. 
" However high and mighty a king's man be, I say 
That he his lord's commandments should never dare gainsay." 
And to himself smiled Gunther whilst she laid down the law : 
He had no thought of service whene'er he Siegfried saw.

729. 
She spake : " My lord beloved, I pray thee, for my sake, 
Lend me thine aid ; that Siegfried may with thy sister take 
Their journey to this country, — that here we them may see ; — 
For nothing that could happen would be more sweet to me. 

730- 
" Thy sister's gentle breeding and well-contented mood, 
Whene'er I think upon them, in sooth, it doth me good. 
How we did sit together, when first I was thy wife ! 
Right well hath she deserved bold Siegfried's love and life." 

731- 
So long she thus besought him, until the king did say : 
" Be sure that guests more welcome could ne'er be any day ; 
'Tis easy to persuade me ! and messengers of mine 
I'll send unto the couple, to bring them to the Rhine." 

732- 

Then spake the queen yet further : " Now also you must say 
When you will send to fetch them, and at what time we may 
Look for our well-loved kinsfolk to come unto our land : 
And whom you purpose sending I fain would understand." 

733- 
" That will I do," the king said : " thirty of mine own men 
Will I send riding thither." These did he summon then, 
And by them sent his message unto Prince Siegfried's land. 
Dame Brunhild to content them gave much apparel grand. 

734. 
Then said the king : " This message ye'll take, my warriors bold, 
Wherewith I now entrust ye — see that ye naught withhold — 
Unto the mighty Siegfried and to my sister dear : 
That in this world doth no one more kindness to them bear.

735- 
"And pray that both do shortly come to us on the Rhine, 
For which we'll ever thank them, I and this lady mine. 
Before this next midsummer he and his men shall see 
Things done, which to his pleasure and honour great shall be. 

736. 
" And likewise to King Siegmund my service take and say, 
That I and all my people be bound to him alway. 
Say also to my sister, that she must tarry not ; 
More worthy entertainment shall never be her lot." 

737- 
Brunhilda and Queen Ut^, and every dame at hand, 
Sent messages of service to all in Siegfried's land ; 
Unto the lovely women, and many a man of worth. — 
Then by the king's good pleasure the messengers set forth. 

738. 
In trav'lling guise they journey 'd ; their steeds and wearing-gear 
Were ready made beforehand ; so from the land they fare. 
They madg good progress onward to where their goal did lie. 
The king came with an escort to speed his embassy. 

739- 
At end of three weeks' riding they came into the land 
Wherein the Niblung stronghold, where they were sent, did stand 
On the Norwegian border ; and there they found the thane. 
Both steeds and men were weary with their long journey's pain. 

740. 
Then was it unto Siegfried and to Kriemhilda said 
How knights had come on horseback and so apparelled 
As in Burgundian country the fashion was that day : 
Straight from the couch up-sprang she whereon she resting lay.

741. 
And quickly to a window she bade a maiden go, 
Who saw the gallant Gere stand in the court below, 
Him and the comrades with him, who had been thither sent ; 
Instead of all her heartache how great was her content ! 

742. 
Unto the king then spake she : " Now look you down below, 
How they with doughty Gere about the courtyard go, 
Whom my good brother Gunther here down the Rhine hath sent ! " 
The stalwart Siegfried answered : " We'll make them well content." 

743- 
Then all the court attendants did hasten out to greet, 
And every one among them did speak a welcome meet ; 
They gave unto the envoys the best words that they had. 
The old King Siegmund likewise was of their coming glad. 

744. 
A lodging was appointed for Gere and his men, 
The horses too were cared for. The messengers went then 
Unto the hall where Siegfried near to Kriemhilda sat. 
At court they had free entry : and therefore did they that. 

745. 
The host rose with the hostess and near to them did stand. 
Right well was Gere welcomed from the Burgundian land, 
With all his knightly comrades, — King Gunther's men to wit. 
The noble Gere bade they upon the bench to sit. 

746. 
" Before we sit allow us to tell you of our news ; 
Though weary with our journey, to stand the while we choose. 
We have to give a message which unto you we bring 
From Gunther and Brunhilda, — and weighty is this thing. 



128 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

747- 
" And likewise what Dame Ute, your mother, sendeth you, 
And Giselher the young knight, and noble Gemot too, 
And all your nearest kinsfolk, from whom we have command 
To offer you their greeting from the Burgundian land." 

748. 
" Now God reward ye, heralds," cried Siegfried, " and I trust 
Unto your truth and kindness, — as towards friends we must, — 
So likewise doth their sister ; — and now your tidings give 
If still our friends beloved at home in gladness live. 

749- 
" Since we from them departed hath no one evil done 
Unto Kriemhilda's kinsmen ? let that to me be known. 
My faithful help is ready in ev'ry time of need, 
Until mine aid and service their foes shall rue indeed ! " 

750- 
Then quoth the Margrave Gere, — he was a warrior good : 
*' Right happily abide they in all good livelihood ; 
They bid you to the Rhineland, to a high festival ; 
Right gladly will they see you, of that doubt not at all. 

751- 
" They pray my lady also that she will thither wend 
So soon as e'er the winter shall come unto its end. 
Before this next midsummer your faces would they see." 
Then spake the stalwart Siegfried : " Nay, that can hardly be ! " 

752. 
But further spake Sir Gere, from the Burgundian land ; 
"It is your mother Ute who maketh this demand; 
Eke Giselher and Gemot, ye must not them gainsay : 
That ye be so far distant I hear complaints each day. 



XII.] HOW GUNTHER BADE SIEGFRIED. I29 

753- 
" Brunhilda, too, my mistress, and all her maidens fair 
Rejoice at this my errand ; if likelihood there were 
That they once more might see you, happy would be their 

mood." 
Unto the fair Krierahilda this message seemed right good. 

754. 
As Gere was her kinsman, the host then bade him sit. 
Wine for the guests he ordered ; nor long they wanted it. 
And thither, too, came Siegmund, who had the heralds seen ; 
To the Burgundian heroes he spake with friendly mien : 

755- 
** Be welcome, Gunther's liegemen, ye warriors, every one ! 
Since it hath happ'd that Siegfried my son to wife hath won 
Kriemhilda fair, more often ye would we gladly see 
In this our land, if truly to us ye'll friendly be." 

756. 
They said that if he wish'd it they'd gladly come again. 
And so in pleasure vanish'd their weariness and pain. 
The messengers were seated, and food was brought them there : 
For guests so welcome Siegfried had plenty of good fare. 

757. 
For nine days' space and longer to stay they were constrain'd. 
Until, at last, the horsemen, who would be gone, complain'd 
That back into their country they never more would ride. 
Meanwhile his friends King Siegfried had summon'd to his side, 

758- 
To ask them what they counsell'd : would they go to the Rhine ? 
" He hath sent here to fetch me, Gunther, that friend of mine, — 
He and his kinsfolk bid us to keep festivity : 
I'd gladly go there, save that his land too far doth lie.

759- 
" They also bid Kriemhilda to go along with me. 
Now counsel me, dear kinsmen, how thither come shaH she ? 
If I through thirty kingdoms my men, for them, must lead, 
Still Siegfried's hand to serve them must ready be indeed." 

760. 
Then spake his chiefs unto him : " If you've a mind unto 
The journey to this hightide, we'll counsel what to do : 
You with a thousand warriors unto the Rhine shall ride ; 
So may you with all honour in Burgundy abide." 

761. 
Then spake the noble Siegmund, of Netherland the lord : 
*' Will ye unto this feasting, and tell me not a word ? 
An if it will not shame you I'll ride along with you ; 
I'll take a hundred swordsmen to swell your retinue." 

762. 
"Wilt thou in sooth ride with us, my own good father dear ?'* 
Exclaimed the gallant Siegfried : "right gladly that I hear. 
Before twelve days are over my fatherland I'll leave." 
To all who did desire them they steeds and raiment gave. 

763- 
Now that the noble ruler was minded soon to start, 
The heralds swift were bidden straight homewards to depart, 
And unto his wife's kinsmen upon the Rhine to say, 
That he would very gladly with them keep holyday. 

764. 
Both Siegfried and Kriemhilda, as doth the story say, 
More gifts gave to the heralds than could be borne away 
On their own horses homewards : a wealthy man was he I 
Their sturdy beasts of burden they drove right merrily. 



XII.] HOW GUNTHER BADE SIEGFRIED. I3I 

765. 
Their folk were cloth'd by Siegfried and Siegmund worthily. 
And Eckewart the margrave gave orders speedily 
To seek out women's raiment, the best that could be found, 
Or anywhere be heard of in Siegfried's lands around. 

766. 
The saddles and the bucklers began they to prepare. 
And to the knights and ladies who should the journey share, 
Was given whate'er they wanted, that they might fail in naught. 
Unto his friends full many a noble guest he brought. 

767. 
The heralds did not loiter upon the journey home. 
And soon the gallant Gere to Burgundy was come, 
Where right well was he welcomed : they then alighted all 
From chargers and from palfreys before King Gunther's hall. 

768. 
The youths went and the elders, as men are wont to do, 
To ask what might the news be. Then spake the good knight true : 
" When to the king I've told it the rest of you shall know." 
Then straightway with his comrades did he to Gunther go. 

769- 

The king, in joy to see them, rose quickly from his chair. 
That they had come so swiftly also from Brunhild fair 
Received they thanks, while Gunther unto the envoys spake: 
" How fares it now with Siegfried ? much wrought he for my sake." 

770. 
Then spake the gallant Gere : " For joy his face grew red, — 
Both his and your fair sister's ; and ne'er was message sped, 
From any man of honour unto his friends, more true 
Than Siegfried and his father by me have sent to you.'' 



132 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

771. 
Then thus unto the margrave the noble king's wife spake : 
*'Say, now, is Kriemhild coming? and care doth she yet take 
To keep the outward fairness, which she to foster knew ? " 
"Aye," said the warrior Gere, "doubtless she comes to you." 

772. 
Then Ute to her presence the heralds did command, 
And by her question might one right plainly understand 
What she to hear was longing : " Still well did Kriemhild fare ? " 
He told how he had found her, and that she'd soon be there. 

773- 
Nor from the court retainers did they the gifts withhold 
That they had had from Siegfried : the raiment and the gold 
In sight of all the liegemen of the three kings were spread. 
For their abundant largesse were many thanks repaid. 

774. 
"'Tis easy," then said Hagen, "for him such gifts to give : 
He could not spend his riches did he for ever live. 
The treasure of the Niblungs he holds within his hand. 
Ha, what if it should ever come to Burgundian land ! " 

775- 
Then was there great rejoicing among the people all 
That soon the guests were coming. From dawn till evenfall 
The three kings' craftsmen labour'd, with zeal untiring fiU'd. 
Grand rows of seats in plenty they then began to build. 

776. 
The valiant Sir Hunold and Sindold too, the thane. 
Had little time for leisure ; they too must work amain, 
As steward and cupbearer the places they must set. 
And Ortwein help'd them: wherefore they Gunther's thanks 
did get. 



XIII.] HOW THEY JOURNEYED TO THE FESTIVAL. 1 33 

777- 
Rumold the kitchenmaster, knew well to rule aright 
His underlings and scullions ! Ay me ! it was a sight 
To see the polish'd kettles and pots and pans at hand ! 
For food must be made ready when guests were in the land.
