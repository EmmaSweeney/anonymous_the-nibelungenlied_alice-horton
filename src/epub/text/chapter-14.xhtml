			<h2>Adventure XIV.— HOW THE QUEENS RAILED AT ONE ANOTHER.</h2>

814. 
Before the hour of vespers one day the tumult loud 
Was heard, of many warriors, who in the court did crowd. 
Their knightly feats they practised to pass the time away : 
And many a man and woman ran up to watch the play. 

815. 
The noble queens were seated together, side by side, 
They thought of two bold warriors, renowned far and wide. 
Then said the fair Kriemhilda : " I have indeed a lord 
Who rightly is the ruler of all this kingdom broad." 

816. 
Then cried the Lady Brunhild : " Howe'er could such thing be, 
Unless there were none living but only thou and he ? 
Beneath his rule the kingdom might fall in such a case : 
So long as Gunther liveth, it could not come to pass."

817. 

But then again said Kriemhild : " There stands he ; dost thou see 
How he before the warriors doth walk right royally ? 
Just as the moon all brightly above the stars doth shine ! 
Good cause have I for wearing this happy mood of mine." 

818. 
Then Lady Brunhild answer'd : " Comely as is thy lord, 
And gallant too and handsome, thou must the meed award 
Unto thy brother Gunther, the noble warrior : 
Who, be it known, is truly all other kings before." 

819. 
But yet again said Kriemhild : " Mine is a man so rare, 
That not without good reason his praises I declare. 
By many deeds great honour he hath won, far and near ; 
Thou wilt allow, Brunhilda, he well is Gunther's peer.^ 

820. 
" I pray thee now, Kriemhilda, take it not ill of me, 
I, too, have grounds for saying what I have said to thee : 
I heard them both allow it, when them I first look'd on, 
And, as he would, against me the king my wager won, — 

821. 
What time my love he gained in such a knightly siege, 
Siegfried himself confessed it, that he was Gunther's liege. 
Therefore I hold him vassal, I heard him that allow." 
Then spake the fair Kriemhilda : " For me 'twere ill enow I 

822. 
" How could my noble brother have hansell'd so for me 
That of a mere retainer the good-wife I should be ? 
I do beseech thee, Brunhild, in all true friendliness, 
Oblige me of your kindness and let these cavils cease."

823. 
Thereon the king's wife answer'd : " I will not let it be ! 
Why should I yield my claim to so many a good knight's fee, 
Who, like the thane, thy husband, doth suit and service owe ? " 
At this the beauteous Kriemhild began with wrath to glow. 

824. 
*' The thought thou must abandon, that he to thee did e'er 
Owe any kind of service ; he is far worthier 
Than is my brother Gunther, — right noble though he be. 
Withdraw me now this saying that I have heard from thee ! 

825. 
" I cannot choose but wonder, since he thy vassal is, 
And thou o'er our two persons hast mastery like this, 
That he his dues unto you hath set so long aside ! 
With right do I demur to thine overweening pride." 

826. 
" Thou ratest thyself too highly ! " the king's wife answer'd then, 
*' Now will I gladly prove me whether thou hast of men 
As much respect and honour as they accord to me ! " 
By this time both the ladies were wrathful as could be. 

827. 
Then cried the Lady Kriemhild : " This must at once be seen ! 
If that my lord's thy vassal, as thou hast sworn, O queen, 
To-day must I the liegemen of both the kings let know 
Whether before the king's wife to church I dare to go. 

828. 
" This very day I'll show thee that I am fealty-free, 
And that my man's more worthy than ever thine will be I 
And I myself, moreover, will not be slighted so : 
Thou shalt to-day be witness how I, thy vassal, go

829. 
To court before the warriors of royal Burgundy. 
I'll prove myself more worthy than e'er was known to be 
Any princess whatever who here hath worn the crown ! " 
Thus hate enough and envy betwixt the dames was sown. 

830. 
"Dost thou deny," cried Brunhild, "that thou our vassal art ? 
So must thou with thy women keep from my train apart. 
When I and my attendants unto the minster go." 
To that Kriemhilda answer'd : " In truth, it shall be so ! " 

831. 
** Now robe yourselves, my maidens," commanded Siegfried's wife. 
" For we no shame must suffer whilst here we live our life ; 
That ye have rich apparel ye must let all folk see. 
She shall repent at leisure what she hath said to me ! " 

832. 
There was small need to urge them : they sought their richest gear, 
And many a dame and maiden right well-dight did appear. 
When came with her attendants the noble Gunther's dame, 
Then also in fine raiment the fair Kriemhilda came. 

^33- 
With three and forty maidens, whom she to Rhine had brought, 
Who wore fine-woven silk stuffs in Araby y-wrought. 
So came unto the minster the comely maidens all : 
They found all Siegfried's liegemen waiting before the hall. 

834. 
The people fell to marvel how it had come about 
That these two royal ladies had plainly fallen out. 
And went no more together, as erewhile they were fain. 
Therefrom befell hereafter sore woe to many a thane. 



XIV.] HOW THE QUEENS RAILED AT ONE ANOTHER. I43 

835. 
King Gunther's wife stood waiting before the minster door ; 
The while much pleasant pastime had many a warrior 
With the fair waiting- women, whom she with her did bring ; 
Then came the noble Kriemhild with her brave following. 

836. 
Such costume as the daughters of noble knights might wear, 
Compared with what her maids wore was common as the air; 
In gear she was so wealthy, that thirty queens had shown 
No such display of raiment as this fair queen alone. 

837. 
Had anyone been wishful he never could have said 
That any richer clothing had e'er been worn of maid 
Than on that day adorned her noble company : 
Except to vex Brunhilda, Kriemhild had let it be. 

838. 
The two queens came together before the minster wide, 
And thereupon the hostess, by hatred moved and pride. 
With evil voice and gesture Kriemhilda bade to stay : 
" Before the queen a vassal shall ne'er take right of way I" 

839. 
Then spake the fair Kriemhilda : (and wrathful was her mood) 
" Couldst thou but have been silent, for thee it had been good ! 
Thou hast disgraced thy beauty and stain'd thy purity : 
How should a shameless wanton a king's wife ever be ? " 

840. 
" Whom art thou calling *Wanton' ? " in answer cried the queen. 
" That call I thee," quoth Kriemhild'; " thy body fair hath been 
Woo'd first, not by thy husband, but by my lord, Siegfried : 
I trow 'twas not my brother who won thy maidenhead ! 



144 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

841. 
"Where hadst thou left thy senses? it was a trick of his. 
Why didst thou let him woo thee, who but thy liegeman is ? 
I hear thee," said Kriemhilda, " without all reason scold." 
"Now this, in truth," cried Brunhild, " shall be to Gunther told ! " 

842. 
" And why should that annoy me ? thy pride hath thee betray'd : 
To cite me to thy service by word thou hast essay'd. 
This know now, of a surety I grieve that it be so : 
All confidence is over for aye betwixt us two." 

843. 
Brunhilda wept, but Kriemhild no longer tarried there ; 
Before the king's wife passing, with all her maidens fair, 
She went into the minster : such hate did this beget 
That many bright eyes later were sore bedimm'd and wet. 

^ 844. 
How much soe'er they worshipp'd, by service and by song, 
Unto the Queen Brunhilda the time seem'd all too long : 
So full she was of trouble, in body and in mood. 
For which hereafter suffer'd bold warriors and good. 

845- 
Brunhilda with her women stay'd by the minster door ; 
She thought: "Now must Kriemhilda, let me hear somethingmore 
Of what she rail'd so loudly, — the scolding, sharp-tongued wife ! 
If Siegfried hath been boasting, 'twill stand him in his life." 

846. 
Forth came the noble Kriemhild, with many gallant men. 
Dame Brunhild called unto her : " Now stand you still again, — 
You said I was a wanton, that shall you prove to me : 
That word of yours^ be certain, hath stung me bitterly ! " 



XIV.] HOW THE QUEENS RAILED AT ONE ANOTHER. I45 

847. 
Thereto said dame Kriemhilda : " 'Twere best to let me fare ! 
By this gold ring I'll prove it, which on my hand I wear ; 
'Twas brought to me by Siegfried when by your side he lay." 
Ne'er yet had Queen Brunhilda outlived a sadder day. 



She spake ; " This golden jewel was from me stol'n away, 
And hath from me most wrongly been hidden many a day. 
I now at last discover who stole my ring from me ! " 
By this time were both ladies in direst enmity. 

849. 
Yet spake Kriemhilda further : " I will not pass for thief ! 
Thou mightst have kept thy counsel, to thee were honour lief. 
This girdle be my witness, that round my waist I wear, 
That I am not a liar. Ay ! Siegfried was thy dear." 

850. 
The girdle she was wearing was silk from Nineveh, 
With precious stones for fastening, right good it was to see. 
When dame Brunhild beheld it to weeping she did fall : 
It must be told to Gunther and to his lieges all. 

851. 
Then spake the queen in answer : " Go hence, and bring to me 
The sovran-prince of Rhineland, and from my lips shall he 
Hear how his sister flouts me, and slandereth my life, 
By openly declaring I have been Siegfried's wife 1 " 

852. 
The king came with his warriors ; and when the weeping eyes 
He saw of his belov'd one, he spake, in kindly wise : 
*' Now tell me, dearest lady, who hath done aught to thee ? " 
Unto the king she answered : " Aye joyless must I be 1

853. 
" Kriemhilda of mine honour would like to cozen me ; 
And, seeing she's thy sister, I make complaint to thee. 
She swears I've played the wanton with her own man, Siegfried." 
Then answer'd the King Gunther : " She doth an evil deed ! " 

854. 
" She weareth here my girdle, which I so long have lost, 
My ring of red gold likewise. To me 'tis bittermost 
That e'er my mother bore me. An' thou wilt not disprove, 
O king, this grievous scandal, no longer thee I'll love." 

855. 
Then up and spake King Gunther : " Siegfried shall now appear ; 
If he hath play'd the braggart, he shall the truth declare, 
Or else deny the slander, — this knight of Netherland ! " 
Then did Kriemhilda's husband right soon before them stand. 

856. 
As soon as he had look'd on these dames discomfited, 
(Naught knowing of the matter) the noble Siegfried said : 
" Why are these ladies weeping ? that am I fain to hear, 
And wherefore I am bidden before the King to appear ? " 

857. 
Then spake to him King Gunther : " Right sorrowful am I ; 
To me my wife Brunhilda hath told a history 
That thou thyself hast boasted her first love to have won : 
Thy wife, Kriemhild, declareth that thou, thane, this hast done." 

858. 
Then spake the noble Siegfried : " And if she so hath said, 
Before I rest I'll see that for this she be repaid ! 
In face of all your lieges I'm ready to aver 
By oath of mine most solemn, I never told it her ! " 



XIV.] HOW THE QUEENS RAILED AT ONE ANOTHER. I47 

859- 
Then spake the King of Rhineland: "Give proof of that must thou ! 
The oath which thou dost offer, if thou canst take it now, 
From ev'ry untrue deahng I'll hold thee clear and free." 
Then in a ring around him stood they of Burgundy. 

860. 
His hand the gallant Siegfried outstretched the oath to take. 
Then spake the mighty sovran : "So certain do I make 
Of thy great innocency, that I will thee acquit : 
Sure what my sister charges thou never didst commit." 

861. 
Yet once again spake Siegfried : " And if she joy doth find 
In that she hath so troubled Brunhilda's peace of mind, 
My sorrow, of a surety, too deep were to be told." 
Then look'd at one another these ready knights and bold. 

862. 
" So should one train one's women," the hero Siegfried said, 
" That suchlike haughty speeches should aye be left unsaid : 
Unto thy wife forbid them, to mine I'll do the same ; 
Such ill-advised behaviour doth fill my heart with shame." 

863. 
By this dispute were many fair women kept apart. 
Brunhilda still the matter so sorely took to heart 
That needs must Gunther's warriors feel pity for the dame. 
Then Hagen, knight of Tronje, unto his lady came. 

864. 
He bade her say what ail'd her, finding her weeping sore. 
Then told she him the story, and unto her he swore 
That either Kriemhild's husband must for the lie repent 
Or he himself thereafter would never live content.

865. 
Ortwein and also Gemot, in council join'd the twain ; 
And there the heroes plotted how Siegfried should be slain. 
And Giselher came likewise, the noble Ute's son ; 
When he had heard their saying, he spake, — the faithful one : 

866. 
"Alack ! ye gallant warriors, now wherefore do ye that? 
I trow that never Siegfried deserved such like hate. 
That he, by reason of it, should need to lose his life : 
Ay, very trifles are they that make an angry wife ! " 

867. 
** Are we to harbour cuckoos ? " cried Hagen, answering : 
" To gallant knights as we are scant honour that would bring ! 
That he of my dear lady hath bragg'd so scurvily 
His life shall make atonement ; or I myself will die." 

868. 
The king himself spake, saying : " Naught hath he to us done 
Save what is good and worthy ; so let his life alone. 
What matter though the warrior were hateful now to me ? 
He hath been ever faithful and that right willingly." 



Then spake the warrior Ortwein, who came from Metz, and said 
" His great strength, of a surety, shall give him little aid. 
If now my lord allow me, short shrift of him I'll make." 
Thus, without cause, the heroes the part of foes did take. 

870. 
But none went any further, save Hagen, who for aye. 
Was pressing upon Gunther this counsel day by day : 
That, if King Siegfried lived not, to him would subject be 
The broad lands that he governed ;— the king heard ruefully. 



XIV.] HOW THE QUEENS RAILED AT ONE ANOTHER. I49 

871. 
They let the matter rest; then to jousting did they take. 
Ha ! many a sturdy lance-shaft for Siegfried's wife they brake 
In shadow of the minster, up to the royal hall ! 
Yet were some men of Gunther's but ill-content withal. 

872. 
The king spake : " Lay aside now this murd'rous hate and scorn ; 
Unto our weal and honour he verily was born. 
So fierce his strength is also, this marvellous-bold knight, 
Had he of this an inkling, none durst withstand his might." 

873. 
" He'll never know," quoth Hagen, " save thou should let it out ! 
I trow that I in secret can bring it so about 
That for Brunhilda's weeping sore reckoning he shall pay. 
Yea, verily is Hagen his enemy for aye." 

874. 
Then spake the royal Gunther: "And how may that be done? " 
And Hagen said in answer : " That will I now make known. 
We'll bid two unknown envoys to ride as from afar 
Unto our land, 'fore all men to challenge us to war. 

875. 
" Then thou, before the guests, wilt declare that thou must go 
To battle, with thy liegemen ; and when he that doth know 
He'll offer you his service : so shall he lose his life. 
I'll seek to learn his secret from the bold warrior's wife." 

876. 
Unto his vassal Gunther in evil hour gave ear. 
With treason foul to tamper, ere any grew aware, 
Began those chosen warriors of chivalry the boast. 
By wrangling of two women was many a hero lost.
