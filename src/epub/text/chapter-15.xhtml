			<h2>Adventure XV.— HOW SIEGFRIED WAS BETRAYED.</h2>

877. 
Upon the fourth day morning came two and thirty men 
Unto the king's court riding ; and word was carried then 
To Gunther, the most mighty, that he was call'd to war. 
The lie cost many a woman much grief and sorrow sore. 

878. 
When leave to them was granted, before the king they went, 
And said that they were under King Lud'ger's government, — 
Who vanquish'd was aforetime by doughty Siegfried's hand, 
And brought by him a captive unto King Gunther's land. 

879. 
Then greeted he the heralds, and bade them seated be. 
But one among them pray'd him : " Sire, let us stand, till we 
Our message have deliver'd and errand duly done : 
Know then that thou art hated by many a mother's son ! 

880. 
" King Ludegast and Lud'ger, do challenge you to war, 
Of whom you were aforetime the bloody conqueror : 
They're coming with their armies, to ride thy country through." 
At this the king feign'd anger, as if to him 'twere new. 



They took these counterfeiters to hostel presently. 
How then could Siegfried ware be of any treachery, — 
Could he or any other suspect they played a part ? 
Unto themselves hereafter befell the pain and smart.

882. 
The king with his advisers were whispering without cease; 
Nor would Hagen of Tronje e'er let him be at peace. 
Though many a lord would gladly have given up the plot, 
Yet Hagen from his counsel would never swerve a jot. 

883. 
One day it chanced that Siegfried came on this scheming band ; — 
And straight began to ask them the Lord of Netherland : 
" Why goes the king so sadly, thus brooding with his men ? 
Hath any done him mischief, I'll help avenge it then." 

884. 
Then up and spake King Gunther : " Cause have I sad to be ! 
For Ludegast and Lud'ger have straightly challenged me : 
The eyes of all shall see them here riding in my land." 
Then cried the gallant hero : " Right soon shall Siegfried's hand, 

885. 
"As doth beseem your honour, this business undertake 
To break these warriors* power, as it erewhile I brake : 
Their strongholds shall be ruin'd, their land be ravaged, 
Ere I with them have ended : thereon I stake my head ! 

886. 
You may with all your warriors at home stay quietly, 
And let me ride to battle with those who came with me. 
That willingly I serve you, you very soon shall know : 
Your foes by me shall suffer as ne'er before, I trow." 

887. 
"This is to me good hearing," the king in answer said, — 
As if he were in earnest well-pleased to have his aid. 
Before the knight low bow'd he, — the false and faithless knave ! 
Ther said the noble Siegfried : " No care you need to have ! "

888. 
With their esquires and liegemen they plann'd the journey then : 
'Twas done for the deceiving of Siegfried and his men. 
He bade them all be ready, his men of Netherland : 
And soon had Siegfried's warriors their fighting gear at hand. 

889. 
Then spake the gallant Siegfried : " My father Siegmund, pray 
Remain thou here behind us ; we shall not long delay ; 
If so be that God speed us, we'll come back to the Rhine. 
So with the king abiding shall happy days be thine ! " 

890. 
The banner they unfurled, as though they fain would start. 
Of Gunther's liegemen present there were a goodly part 
Who naught knew of the message, nor what it all did mean : 
A mighty throng of people round Siegfried there was seen. 

891. 
Their helmets and their breastplates on horses they did stow ; 
And many a stout knight hastened to leave the land and go. 
Then went Hagen of Tronj^ to where Kriemhild did stand, 
And prayed for leave of absence, since they would quit the land. 

892. 
" Thrice happy I," cried Kriemhild, " that I have got for lord 
One who to my dear kinsmen such succour can accord, 
As doth my dear lord Siegfried unto my kindred here. 
Therefore," the queen said, " will I be now of right good cheer. 

893- 
" But you, my good friend Hagen, one thing remember still ; 
That I would gladly serve you, nor e'er have done you ill ; 
For this you can requite me to my dear lord one day : 
If I've done aught to Brunhild for that he must not pay !

894. 
" For since then I have rued it," the noble lady said ; 
" He therefore hath my body most sorely punished. 
If I did ever utter aught to enrage her mood, 
Right well hath he avenged her, the hero bold and good." 

895. 
" You yet shall be forgiven, in days to come," quoth he ; 
" Kriemhilda, my dear lady, now must you tell to me 
How through your husband Siegfried to serve you I may try ; 
I'll gladly do it, lady ; to none more willingly." 

896. 
" I should have no misgivings," replied the noble wife, 
" Lest any one in battle should jeopardize his life ; 
If he were not so reckless and over-rash of mood 
He aye might be in safety, my gallant thane and good." 

897. 
Thereon said Hagen, " Lady, if you have any fear 
Lest any one should wound him, 'twere best to let me hear 
The arts that I must practise if any ill betide ; 
For I will ever guard him, whether I walk or ride." 



She spake : " Thou art my kinsman, as I, in sooth, am thine ; 
Therefore to thee I'll trust him, this darling love of mine, 
That thou mayst guard him for me, — this husband of my own." 
Then told she him the story 'twere well he had not known. 

899. 
She spake : " Bold is my husband and strong enough thereto. 
When he upon the mountain erstwhile the dragon slew, 
In the brute's blood he bathed him, the goodly warrior. 
And since that day, in battle, no steel can cut him more. 



154 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

900. 
" Yet, no less am I anxious when he in fight doth stand 
And javelins fly around him from many a hero's hand, 
Lest by mischance I lose him, and mourn my husband dear. 
Alas, what sorrow have I for Siegfried's sake to bear ! 

901. 

" I'll tell it as a favour, my dearest friend, to thee, — 
In faith that thou maintainest the pledge thou gav'st to me, — 
Where, only, may be wounded this husband dear of mine, 
I'll let thee hear, confiding unto no ear but thine. 

902. 
" When from the dragon's death-wounds came pouring the hot 

blood 
And therein he was bathing himself, the warrior good, — 
There fell between his shoulders a large-sized linden-leaf: 
On that spot one may wound him ; 'tis this doth cause my grief." 

903- 
Then spake Hagen of Tronje : " Upon his garment sew 
A little token for me, that I the spot may know 
Where I have got to shield him, when we stand in the strife." 
She thought to save the hero : by this he lost his life. 

904. 
She spake : ** With fine silk will I upon his garment sew 
A little cross unnoticed, that so thy hand may know, 
O hero, where to guard him, when into fight he goes, 
And in the stress of battle he stands before his foes." 

905- 
" That will I do," quoth Hagen, " my lady dear." Whereon 
The lady thought some vantage she for her lord had won : 
And yet Kriemhilda's husband was by this means betray'd. 
His leave then took Sir Hagen, and went away right glad.

906. 
The king's men and retainers were all of cheerful mood. 
And yet, I ween, no warrior within his breast e'er could 
Hide heart so false and perjured, as he in his did hide 
Upon whose faith and promise Kriemhild the queen relied. 

907. 
Upon the next day morning with his own thousand men 
Rode forth the gallant Siegfried : and joyful was he then. 
He thought he would take vengeance for his friend's injury. 
To him rode Hagen closely that he his coat might eye. 

908. 
When he espied the token, two of his following 
He sent away in secret another tale to bring : 
How peace should not be broken towards King Gunther's land, — 
They had but come as envoys by Ludeger's command. 

909. 
How loth turn'd Siegfried homewards; he rode unwillingly, 
Sad that his friend's annoyance thus unavenged should be ! 
Hardly could Gunther's warriors bring him to turn his ranks. 
Unto the king straight rode he : his host began his thanks. 

910. 
*' Now God reward thy goodwill, my noble friend Siegfried ! 
That thou didst go so gladly to help me in my need, 
I aye shall be thy debtor, as I of right should be. 
Beyond all friends and kinsmen I build my faith on thee. 

911. 
" Now that this expedition will trouble us no more, 
I fain would go a-hunting the wild bear and the boar 
At VVaskenwalde, yonder, as I so oft have done." 
This was the plan of Hagen, the false and faithless one. 



156 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

912. 
"To all guests in my palace due notice shall there be 
That I will ride forth early : those who would hunt with me 
Must hold themselves all ready ; those who would rather stay 
To loiter with the ladies have my good leave alway." 



913- 

Then spake the stalwart Siegfried, with noble courtliness : 
" If you will ride a-hunting, Til gladly do no less. 
A huntsman you must lend me, and sundry hounds also, 
Then gladly to the forest along with you I'll go." 

914. 
" And dost thou want one only ? " the king said thereupon, 
" I'll lend thee, if it please thee, four men to whom are known 
The forest and the coverts the quarry most frequent ; 
So that the tryst in seeking thy time be not misspent." 

915- 
Home to his wife then rode he, the goodly warrior bold. 
And quickly faithless Hagen unto the king had told 
How he could get the vantage of the brave thane : 'twere shame 
Such treason foul should ever disgrace a noble name.
