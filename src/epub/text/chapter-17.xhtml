			<h2>Adventure XVII.— HOW KRIEMHILDA MOURN'D FOR HER HUSBAND, AND HOW HE WAS BURIED</h2>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then waited they for nightfall, and o'er the Rhine did row:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Ne'er to more direful ending could heroes hunting go.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The quarry they had slaughter'd mourn'd noble maids and wives:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And many goodly warriors paid for it with their lives.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Of arrogance o'erweening the tale ye soon shall hear,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And of a fearful vengeance. Then Hagen bade men bear</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The body of dead Siegfried, the Niblung lord of late,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And lay it in a chamber wherein Kriemhild did wait.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>He had him laid in secret down close beside her door,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That she might find him lying when she, as heretofore,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Went forth to matins early, ere daylight had begun;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Which duty dame Kriemhilda but seldom left undone.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The wonted bell was ringing, which to the minster bade;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then rose the fair Kriemhilda and waken'd many a maid:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>She bade them bring a taper, and fetch her all her gear.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then came a chamber-servant who lit on Siegfried there.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>In red blood he was lying, and all his garb was wet;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But that it was his master he did not know as yet.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Into the room he carried the candle in his hand,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>From him did Dame Kriemhilda some ill news understand.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>For, as she with her women would to the minster fare,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The chamberlain spake to her: " My lady, stay you there!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Right opposite the doorway a murder'd knight doth lie."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whereat began Kriemhilda to weep unmeasuredly.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Before she knew for certain that 'twas her husband dead,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Unto her mind recall'd she how Hagen questioned</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In what way he might guard him: then first she was afraid.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>An he were dead, her pleasure was all to sorrow made.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>To earth down sank she swooning, and ne'er a word could say:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Upon the hapless fair one men gazed as there she lay.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The grief of Dame Kriemhilda was past all measuring:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>After her swoon, the chamber did with her wailing ring.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Her people said unto her: " What if it be a guest? "</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But from her mouth came flowing the blood, by anguish press'd;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then spake she: "'Tis my husband, my own belov'd Siegfried:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>It was Brunhilda's counsel, and Hagen did the deed."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The lady bade them lead her where she her hero found.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With her white hand she lifted his fair head from the ground;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Red as he was with blood-stains, well knew she him again.—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>There lay the Niblung hero, so pitifully slain.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then in her sorrow cried she, that fair and gentle queen:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Woe on mine evil fortune! Upon thy shield is seen</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>No dint of any sword-stroke: thou liest murder'd there.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And wist I who hath done it, of death mote he be ware."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Thereon all her attendants began to wail and weep:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With their beloved lady, their grief indeed was deep</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>About their noble master, of whom they were forlorn.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Thus heavily had Hagen made good Brunhilda's scorn.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then sorrowfully spake she: " Go hence now, all of ye,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And waken Siegfried's liegemen as quickly as may be.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And unto Siegmund also my sorrow must ye tell.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>If so be he will help me to mourn brave Siegfried well."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>A messenger ran swiftly and found them where they lay,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Siegfried's own band of heroes from Niblung land were they.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He told the grievous tidings, and joy fled at his word;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Yet would they not believe it till they the wailing heard.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The messenger sped further to where he found the king.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Unto the noble Siegmund that night no sleep did bring;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>His heart within foreboded what happ'd to him, I ween:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>How that his dear son living should never more be seen.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>'" Awake, arise, Lord Siegmund! Kriemhilda, my mistress,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Hath bidden me to fetch thee; to her a sore distress</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Hath happ'd beyond all others, which cuts her to the heart:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And thou must help her mourning, for thou in it hast part."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Upstarted Siegmund, crying: " What grief hath happened</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Unto the fair Kriemhilda, as thou just now hast said?"</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then spake the herald, weeping, " I cannot it withhold:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Ay! Siegfried hath been murder'd, the Netherlander bold! "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then spake the noble Siegmund: " Pray let this jesting be,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And of such evil stories, beware, for love of me,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The like you tell to no man,—how Siegfried hath been slain:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In such case could I never live happily again."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" If thou wilt not believe me when thou hast heard my tale,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With thine own ears 'tis easy to hear Kriemhilda wail;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For she and all her people are mourning Siegfried dead."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then sore afraid was Siegmund: and sad was he indeed.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Straight from his couch upsprang he, with five score of his men;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They reach'd their hands in search of their weapons long and keen.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And ran, grief-stricken, thither to where they heard the cries;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then, too, the thousand warriors of Siegfried bold did rise.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Whilst piteously the women were heard to weep and moan,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Some of the men bethought them that raiment they should don:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Ay, scarcely for their trouble could they their senses keep.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And bitter was the anguish that in their hearts lay deep.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Soon came the royal Siegmund to where Kriemhild did stand.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He spake: "Woe on the journey that brought us to this land</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Who hath thy husband taken, and reft me of my son.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And, amidst friends and kinsmen, thus murderously done? "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Ah, if I only knew him! " the noble wife did say,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" No mercy would I show him, in mind or body aye:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Such evil would I do him, that if his kith and kin</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Had not good cause for weeping, 'twould be no fault of mine."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then in his arms did Siegmund the murder'd prince enfold;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whereat his friends their sorrow so little could withhold,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That with their lamentation the palace rang and hall;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And even through Worms city, the sounds of woe did fall.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>To none who strove to comfort did Siegfried's wife give heed.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Meanwhile from out its clothing his body fair they freed;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They washed his wounds with water, and laid him on the bier;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The sorrow of his people right grievous was to hear.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then up and spake his warriors the men of Niblung-land:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" With right goodwill shall vengeance be taken at our hand;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Within this very fortress is he who did the deed."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then ran they all for weapons the liegemen of Siegfried.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>These thanes, for valour chosen, each with his shield, were there,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>A thousand and one hundred, ready at hand they were</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To follow noble Siegmund. The murder of his son</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He to avenge was eager,—'twas needful to be done.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Nor knew they 'gainst what foemen they had to strive withal,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Unless it might be Gunther and his bold liegemen all,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With whom their master Siegfried, did late a-hunting go.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Kriemhilda saw them arming, and grievous was her woe.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>However deep her sorrow, and dire as was her need,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Yet did she for the Niblungs fear with such mighty dread</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Death, by her brother's liegemen, that she would have them stay:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>She warn'd them in all kindness, as friends each other may.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Thus spake the grief-lorn lady; " My lord Siegmund, what dost</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Thou think to take in hand now? Thou hast not weigh'd the cost.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>King Gunther hath so many bold warriors at command,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That all of ye will perish if ye his knights withstand."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>With shields already lifted, they needs must to the fray;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The noble queen besought them and even bade them stay,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And seek not for a conflict,—these knights of courage high.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Yet would they not forego it; which grieved her verily.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>So said she: " Noble Siegmund, 'twere best to let it be</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Until a fitter season: then will I readily</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Avenge with you mine husband. Who me hath widow made,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To him, when it is proven, shall evil be repaid.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Hereby upon the Rhine-strand dwells many a haughty knight</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I cannot therefore counsel that you with them should fight.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Full thirty warriors have they against our every one.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>God grant that they may prosper as they to us have done!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>"Ye must remain beside me, this grief with me to share;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And, when the day is dawning, ye heroes bold prepare</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To help me in his coffin my husband dear to lay."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then all the thanes made answer: " It shall be as you say."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>No tongue could ever tell you the marvel of it, how</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>From knights as well as ladies arose the cries of woe,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So that throughout the city the noise thereof did sound.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The noble burghers heard it, and quickly throng'd around.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>They mourned with the strangers, for they themselves were sad.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>If fault had been with Siegfried, none told them that it had,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Nor why the noble warrior had forfeited his life.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then wept, too, with the women, each worthy burgher's wife.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The smiths were bidden quickly a coffin to devise</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of gold y- wrought and silver, strong and of mickle size;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They bade them firmly bind it, with temper'd steel and good.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then truly all the people were sorrowful of mood.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The night was spent, and daylight 'twas said would soon appear.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The noble lady bade them unto the minster bear</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Siegfried their noble master, her husband well-beloved.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>One saw his friends all weeping, as they the body moved.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>They brought him to the minster, and toll'd was many a bell:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>On every side the chanting of priests was heard to swell.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And thither came King Gunther, and all his folk with him,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To take part in the mourning; and likewise Hagen grim.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>He said: " My dearest sister, alas, indeed, for thee!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That from thy sorrow's burden can none of us be free:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>We must bewail for ever the loss of Siegfried's life."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>"That do ye without reason," answer'd the mourning wife.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" It never need have happen'd if real your sorrow were;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Me must ye have forgotten,—that may I well aver,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>When I was there bereft of my own beloved one.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I would to God," said Kriemhild, " it had to me been done! "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>They clave unto their lying. Kriemhild began again:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Whoso of you is guiltless, now let him make it plain;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Let each before the people walk up unto the bier;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Thereby the truth that 's in him shall presently appear."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>It is a wondrous marvel that oft hath happened:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That when one sees the slayer beside the murder'd dead.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The wounds afresh start bleeding; as here, too, came to pass.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whereby men saw that Hagen the malefactor was.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Again the wounds bled freely, as they had done afore;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They who had mourn'd him sorely bewail'd him now the more.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then spake aloud King Gunther: "I tell you everyone</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>'Twas vagabonds that slew him: 'twas not by Hagen done."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" These vagabonds, too surely are known to me," she spake,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" By friendly hands, God willing, we'll vengeance on them take!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Thou Gunther and thou Hagen have surely done this thing."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>By this time Siegfried's warriors for strife were hankering.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Kriemhilda spake yet further: "Now share with me my need."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then came those twain unto her who found him lying dead,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They were her brother Gemot and Giselher the youth.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>As many a man did later, these mourn'd for him in sooth.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>With all their hearts they mourn'd him, the husband of Kriemhild.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Now masses must be chanted: the minster soon was fill'd</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With men, and wives, and children,—from every side they came.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>E'en they who little miss'd him mourn'd Siegfried all the same.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Gemot, and Giselher with him, spake: " Sister dear to me,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Now, for this death, take comfort, as verily must be.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>We will atone unto you as long as we shall live."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Yet on the earth was no one who could her comfort give.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>His coffin was made ready wellnigh about mid-day;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then from the bier they raised him, whereon till then he lay.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Fain would the noble lady have kept him from the grave;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Which unto her attendants sore trouble surely gave.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>In richly broider'd vestment they wrapp'd the body round,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And then, I ween, that no one unweeping there was found.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With all her heart wept Ute—a noble woman she—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And each of her attendants the goodly corpse to see.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>When people heard the chanting within the church begin,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And knew that he was coffin'd, they throng'd to enter in:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For his soul's weal and profit what offerings were made!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In sooth, among the foemen good friends enough he had!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Kriemhilda, the poor lady, said to her chamberlain:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" The love they bear towards me will be to them a bane,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Seeing they grudge him nothing and hold me also dear;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For Siegfried's weal 'tis fitting that they his gold should share.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>There was no child so Httle, who any wit might have,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But joined in the almsgiving, ere he was laid in grave.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>More than a hundred masses were sung ere day was done</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And Siegfried's friends and kinsmen came thronging ev'ry one.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>When ended was the chanting the people went away.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then spake the lady Kriemhild: " Ye must not let me stay</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Alone to watch beside him, this knight exceeding brave.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>My joys are, with his body, all buried in the grave.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>"Three days and three nights longer here would I keep him still,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Until of my dear husband my heart has had its fill.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then what if God should order that death should take me too?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then would poor Kriemhild's sorrows no longer trouble you."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The people from the city now homewards went their way.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The priests and monks Kriemhilda besought with her to stay,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>A.nd eke her own attendants, to watch beside the knight.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Forbidding was the darkness and wearisome the light.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>From eating and from drinking did many a man abstain.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>If any cared to take it, to them it was made plain</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That they might have in plenty: Siegmund of that took care.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And yet, full many a labour the Niblung-folk must share:</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>For three whole days, unceasing,—the story thus we hear—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They who had skill in singing must needs the burden bear</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of chanting many an office. What alms to them folk paid!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They who were poor aforetime now wealth in plenty had.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Whene'er they found poor people who nothing had to bring,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They sent them to the minster, with gold for offering</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>From Siegfried's treasure taken. Since life he could not have,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of marks for his soul's welfare they many thousand gave.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The first-fruits were divided in all the land around,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Wherever cloister-houses or goodly folk were found.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of silver and of raiment the poor got ample store:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Men did the Hke as showing what love to him they bore.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Upon the third day early, just at the hour of Mass,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The churchyard wide extending,—that by the minster was,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With country-people's wailing was fill'd from end to end.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In death they did him service, as to a well-loved friend.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>In those four days of mourning, indeed, it hath been said,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That marks full thirty-thousand, or even more, were paid</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For sake of his soul's welfare, and given to the poor.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Laid low was all his beauty, his life was now no more.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>When God was served duly, and all the chants were sung,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>A dreadful cry of sorrow arose from out the throng;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Out of the minster must they now bear him to his grave.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Those who were loth to lose him fresh tears and cries forth gave.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>With cries of lamentation the people follow'd then;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The faces all were joyless of women and of men.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Ere in his grave they laid him they sang and read withal;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Ay! and the priests were worthy who gave him burial.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Or ever Siegfried's widow had come unto the grave,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Her faithful heart with sorrow such bitter strife did have</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That they must needs revive her with water from the spring;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Her bitterness of sorrow was past all measuring.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>It was a mickle wonder that strength again she found.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With cries of pity, helping, the women throng'd around.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then spake the Queen: " O liegemen of Siegfried, hearken ye!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I pray you of your fealty a favour grant to me,—</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" That after all my sorrow this small grace I may gain,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And on his goodly features may set my eyes again."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So long did she beseech them, with all her sorrow's strength,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That they the splendid coffin must break apart at length.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>And then they brought the lady to where her love did lie,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And she his fair head lifted, with white hand tenderly,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And in his death she kiss'd him,—the noble knight and good;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Her shining eyes, for sorrow, were weeping tears of blood.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>It was a piteous parting, if ever there was one.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And so away they bore her; she could not go alone,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For in a swoon and senseless that noble wife lay low;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Her life, for weal appointed, was wellnigh lost in woe.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>When now their noble master within his grave was laid.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Unmeasured was the sorrow that all his followers had.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Who from the Niblung country had borne him company;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And little joy or gladness in Siegmund was to see.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Amongst them there were many who, for their sorrow's sake,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Till those three days were ended nor meat nor drink did take.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Yet could they not their bodies abandon utterly:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So feasting follow'd sorrow, as evermore will be.</span></span>
