			<h2>Adventure XVII.— HOW KRIEMHILDA MOURN'D FOR HER HUSBAND, AND HOW HE WAS BURIED.</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Then waited they for nightfall, and o'er the Rhine did row :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ne'er to more direful ending could heroes hunting go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The quarry they had slaughter'd mourn'd noble maids and wives:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many goodly warriors paid for it with their lives.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of arrogance o'erweening the tale ye soon shall hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of a fearful vengeance. Then Hagen bade men bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The body of dead Siegfried, the Niblung lord of late,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lay it in a chamber wherein Kriemhild did wait.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He had him laid in secret down close beside her door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she might find him lying when she, as heretofore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went forth to matins early, ere daylight had begun ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which duty dame Kriemhilda but seldom left undone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The wonted bell was ringing, which to the minster bade ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then rose the fair Kriemhilda and waken'd many a maid :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She bade them bring a taper, and fetch her all her gear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came a chamber-servant who lit on Siegfried there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In red blood he was lying, and all his garb was wet ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that it was his master he did not know as yet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the room he carried the candle in his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From him did Dame Kriemhilda some ill news understand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For, as she with her women would to the minster fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The chamberlain spake to her : " My lady, stay you there !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right opposite the doorway a murder'd knight doth lie."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat began Kriemhilda to weep unmeasuredly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Before she knew for certain that 'twas her husband dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto her mind recall'd she how Hagen questioned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In what way he might guard him : then first she was afraid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An he were dead, her pleasure was all to sorrow made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To earth down sank she swooning, and ne'er a word could say :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the hapless fair one men gazed as there she lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The grief of Dame Kriemhilda was past all measuring :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After her swoon, the chamber did with her wailing ring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her people said unto her : " What if it be a guest ? "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But from her mouth came flowing the blood, by anguish press'd ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then spake she : "'Tis my husband, my own belov'd Siegfried :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was Brunhilda's counsel, and Hagen did the deed."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The lady bade them lead her where she her hero found.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her white hand she lifted his fair head from the ground ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red as he was with blood-stains, well knew she him again. —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There lay the Niblung hero, so pitifully slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then in her sorrow cried she, that fair and gentle queen :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Woe on mine evil fortune ! Upon thy shield is seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No dint of any sword-stroke : thou liest murder'd there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wist I who hath done it, of death mote he be ware."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereon all her attendants began to wail and weep :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their beloved lady, their grief indeed was deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About their noble master, of whom they were forlorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus heavily had Hagen made good Brunhilda's scorn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then sorrowfully spake she : " Go hence now, all of ye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And waken Siegfried's liegemen as quickly as may be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And unto Siegmund also my sorrow must ye tell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If so be he will help me to mourn brave Siegfried well."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A messenger ran swiftly and found them where they lay, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Siegfried's own band of heroes from Niblung land were they.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He told the grievous tidings, and joy fled at his word ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet would they not believe it till they the wailing heard.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The messenger sped further to where he found the king.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the noble Siegmund that night no sleep did bring ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His heart within foreboded what happ'd to him, I ween :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How that his dear son living should never more be seen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*" Awake, arise, Lord Siegmund ! Kriemhilda, my mistress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath bidden me to fetch thee ; to her a sore distress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath happ'd beyond all others, which cuts her to the heart :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou must help her mourning, for thou in it hast part."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upstarted Siegmund, crying : " What grief hath happened</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the fair Kriemhilda, as thou just now hast said?"</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then spake the herald, weeping, " I cannot it withhold :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay ! Siegfried hath been murder'd, the Netherlander bold ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the noble Siegmund : " Pray let this jesting be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of such evil stories, beware, for love of me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The like you tell to no man, — how Siegfried hath been slain :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In such case could I never live happily again."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" If thou wilt not believe me when thou hast heard my tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thine own ears 'tis easy to hear Kriemhilda wail ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For she and all her people are mourning Siegfried dead."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then sore afraid was Siegmund : and sad was he indeed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Straight from his couch upsprang he, with five score of his men ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They reach'd their hands in search of their weapons long and keen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ran, grief-stricken, thither to where they heard the cries ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, too, the thousand warriors of Siegfried bold did rise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whilst piteously the women were heard to weep and moan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some of the men bethought them that raiment they should don :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, scarcely for their trouble could they their senses keep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bitter was the anguish that in their hearts lay deep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon came the royal Siegmund to where Kriemhild did stand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He spake : "Woe on the journey that brought us to this land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who hath thy husband taken, and reft me of my son.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, amidst friends and kinsmen, thus murderously done ? "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Ah, if I only knew him ! " the noble wife did say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" No mercy would I show him, in mind or body aye :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such evil would I do him, that if his kith and kin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had not good cause for weeping, 'twould be no fault of mine."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then in his arms did Siegmund the murder'd prince enfold ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat his friends their sorrow so little could withhold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That with their lamentation the palace rang and hall ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And even through Worms city, the sounds of woe did fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To none who strove to comfort did Siegfried's wife give heed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meanwhile from out its clothing his body fair they freed ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They washed his wounds with water, and laid him on the bier ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sorrow of his people right grievous was to hear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then up and spake his warriors the men of Niblung-land :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" With right goodwill shall vengeance be taken at our hand ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within this very fortress is he who did the deed."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then ran they all for weapons the liegemen of Siegfried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These thanes, for valour chosen, each with his shield, were there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand and one hundred, ready at hand they were</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To follow noble Siegmund. The murder of his son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He to avenge was eager, — 'twas needful to be done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor knew they 'gainst what foemen they had to strive withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unless it might be Gunther and his bold liegemen all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With whom their master Siegfried, did late a-hunting go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kriemhilda saw them arming, and grievous was her woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>However deep her sorrow, and dire as was her need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet did she for the Niblungs fear with such mighty dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death, by her brother's liegemen, that she would have them stay :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She warn'd them in all kindness, as friends each other may.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus spake the grief-lorn lady; " My lord Siegmund, what dost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou think to take in hand now ? Thou hast not weigh'd the cost.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King Gunther hath so many bold warriors at command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all of ye will perish if ye his knights withstand."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With shields already lifted, they needs must to the fray ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble queen besought them and even bade them stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seek not for a conflict, — these knights of courage high.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet would they not forego it ; which grieved her verily.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So said she : " Noble Siegmund, 'twere best to let it be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until a fitter season : then will I readily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Avenge with you mine husband. Who me hath widow made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To him, when it is proven, shall evil be repaid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Hereby upon the Rhine-strand dwells many a haughty knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot therefore counsel that you with them should fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full thirty warriors have they against our every one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God grant that they may prosper as they to us have done !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"Ye must remain beside me, this grief with me to share;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, when the day is dawning, ye heroes bold prepare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To help me in his coffin my husband dear to lay."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then all the thanes made answer : " It shall be as you say."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No tongue could ever tell you the marvel of it, how</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From knights as well as ladies arose the cries of woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that throughout the city the noise thereof did sound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble burghers heard it, and quickly throng'd around.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They mourned with the strangers, for they themselves were sad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If fault had been with Siegfried, none told them that it had,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor why the noble warrior had forfeited his life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then wept, too, with the women, each worthy burgher's wife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The smiths were bidden quickly a coffin to devise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of gold y- wrought and silver, strong and of mickle size ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They bade them firmly bind it, with temper'd steel and good.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then truly all the people were sorrowful of mood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The night was spent, and daylight 'twas said would soon appear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble lady bade them unto the minster bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Siegfried their noble master, her husband well-beloved.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One saw his friends all weeping, as they the body moved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They brought him to the minster, and toll'd was many a bell :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On every side the chanting of priests was heard to swell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thither came King Gunther, and all his folk with him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take part in the mourning ; and likewise Hagen grim.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He said : " My dearest sister, alas, indeed, for thee !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That from thy sorrow's burden can none of us be free :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We must bewail for ever the loss of Siegfried's life."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*'That do ye without reason," answer'd the mourning wife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" It never need have happen'd if real your sorrow were ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Me must ye have forgotten, — that may I well aver, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I was there bereft of my own beloved one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would to God," said Kriemhild, " it had to me been done ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They clave unto their lying. Kriemhild began again :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Whoso of you is guiltless, now let him make it plain ; —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let each before the people walk up unto the bier ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereby the truth that 's in him shall presently appear.'*</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It is a wondrous marvel that oft hath happened :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That when one sees the slayer beside the murder'd dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wounds afresh start bleeding ; as here, too, came to pass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby men saw that Hagen the malefactor was.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Again the wounds bled freely, as they had done afore ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They who had mourn'd him sorely bewail'd him now the more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then spake aloud King Gunther: "I tell you everyone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Twas vagabonds that slew him : 'twas not by Hagen done."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" These vagabonds, too surely are known to me," she spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" By friendly hands, God willing, we'll vengeance on them take !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou Gunther and thou Hagen have surely done this thing."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By this time Siegfried's warriors for strife were hankering.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kriemhilda spake yet further: "Now share with me my need."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came those twain unto her who found him lying dead, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They were her brother Gemot and Giselher the youth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As many a man did later, these mourn'd for him in sooth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With all their hearts they mourn'd him, the husband of Kriemhild.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now masses must be chanted : the minster soon was fill'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With men, and wives, and children, — from every side they came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>E'en they who little miss'd him mourn'd Siegfried all the same.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gemot, and Giselher with him, spake : " Sister dear to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now, for this death, take comfort, as verily must be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We will atone unto you as long as we shall live."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet on the earth was no one who could her comfort give.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His coffin was made ready wellnigh about mid-day ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then from the bier they raised him, whereon till then he lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fain would the noble lady have kept him from the grave ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which unto her attendants sore trouble surely gave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In richly broider'd vestment they wrapp'd the body round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then, I ween, that no one unweeping there was found.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all her heart wept Ute — a noble woman she —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each of her attendants the goodly corpse to see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When people heard the chanting within the church begin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knew that he was coffin'd, they throng'd to enter in :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his soul's weal and profit what offerings were made !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In sooth, among the foemen good friends enough he had !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kriemhilda, the poor lady, said to her chamberlain :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' The love they bear towards me will be to them a bane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing they grudge him nothing and hold me also dear ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Siegfried's weal 'tis fitting that they his gold should share.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There was no child so Httle, who any wit might have,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But joined in the almsgiving, ere he was laid in grave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More than a hundred masses were sung ere day was done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Siegfried's friends and kinsmen came thronging ev'ry one.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When ended was the chanting the people went away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then spake the lady Kriemhild : " Ye must not let me stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone to watch beside him, this knight exceeding brave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My joys are, with his body, all buried in the grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"Three days and three nights longer here would I keep him still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until of my dear husband my heart has had its fill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then what if God should order that death should take me too ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then would poor Kriemhild's sorrows no longer trouble you."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The people from the city now homewards went their way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The priests and monks Kriemhilda besought with her to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A.nd eke her own attendants, to watch beside the knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forbidding was the darkness and wearisome the light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From eating and from drinking did many a man abstain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If any cared to take it, to them it was made plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they might have in plenty : Siegmund of that took care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet, full many a labour the Niblung-folk must share :</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For three whole days, unceasing, — the story thus we hear —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They who had skill in singing must needs the burden bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of chanting many an office. What alms to them folk paid !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They who were poor aforetime now wealth in plenty had.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whene'er they found poor people who nothing had to bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They sent them to the minster, with gold for offering</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Siegfried's treasure taken. Since life he could not have,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of marks for his soul's welfare they many thousand gave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The first-fruits were divided in all the land around,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherever cloister-houses or goodly folk were found.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of silver and of raiment the poor got ample store :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men did the Hke as showing what love to him they bore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the third day early, just at the hour of Mass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The churchyard wide extending, — that by the minster was, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With country-people's wailing was fill'd from end to end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In death they did him service, as to a well-loved friend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In those four days of mourning, indeed, it hath been said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That marks full thirty-thousand, or even more, were paid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For sake of his soul's welfare, and given to the poor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid low was all his beauty, his life was now no more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When God was served duly, and all the chants were sung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A dreadful cry of sorrow arose from out the throng ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the minster must they now bear him to his grave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those who were loth to lose him fresh tears and cries forth gave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With cries of lamentation the people follow'd then ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The faces all were joyless of women and of men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere in his grave they laid him they sang and read withal ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay ! and the priests were worthy who gave him burial.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or ever Siegfried's widow had come unto the grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her faithful heart with sorrow such bitter strife did have</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they must needs revive her with water from the spring ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her bitterness of sorrow was past all measuring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was a mickle wonder that strength again she found.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With cries of pity, helping, the women throng'd around.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then spake the Queen : " O liegemen of Siegfried, hearken ye !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pray you of your fealty a favour grant to me, —</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" That after all my sorrow this small grace I may gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on his goodly features may set my eyes again."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So long did she beseech them, with all her sorrow's strength,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they the splendid coffin must break apart at length.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then they brought the lady to where her love did lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she his fair head lifted, with white hand tenderly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his death she kiss'd him, — the noble knight and good ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her shining eyes, for sorrow, were weeping tears of blood.</span>

				<span>It was a piteous parting, if ever there was one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so away they bore her ; she could not go alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in a swoon and senseless that noble wife lay low ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her life, for weal appointed, was wellnigh lost in woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When now their noble master within his grave was laid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unmeasured was the sorrow that all his followers had.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who from the Niblung country had borne him company ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And little joy or gladness in Siegmund was to see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Amongst them there were many who, for their sorrow's sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till those three days were ended nor meat nor drink did take.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet could they not their bodies abandon utterly :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So feasting follow'd sorrow, as evermore will be.</span>
