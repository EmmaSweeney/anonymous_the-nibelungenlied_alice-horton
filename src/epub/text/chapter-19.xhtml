			<h2>Adventure XIX.— HOW THE NIBELUNG HOARD WAS BROUGHT TO WORMS</h2>
			<p>
				<span><span>Now when the noble Kriemhild a widow thus was made</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Count Eckewart was with her, and in the land he stay'd</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With all his men, and daily he served her without fail,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And helped his lady often his master to bewail.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>At Worms, hard by the minster, they built for her a hall:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>'Twas very wide and lofty, and richly deck'd withal.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>There, with her own attendants, all joylessly sat she.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>She loved the church's service and went there willingly.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>From where her love lay buried, she seldom was away;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With sorrow-laden spirit she went there every day.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>She prayed to God Almighty to keep his soul aright.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And faithfully and often bewailed was the knight.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Ute and all her women to cheer her aye were fain;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Yet was the heart within her so sorely smit with pain,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>However they might comfort she took not any heed.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>She had for her beloved such all-surpassing need,</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>As for a well-loved husband no other wife ere found.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Thus might one see how virtues in her did much abound.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Unto her end she mourn'd him, as long as she had life,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And soon a mighty vengeance took valiant Siegfried's wife!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>So after all this sorrow—'tis truth—she did abide</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Until the fourth year's halving from when her husband died;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Nor all this time 'twixt Gunther and her did speech arise,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Nor did she once on Hagen, her enemy, set eyes.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then Hagen spake, of Tronje: " Could you not so contrive</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That you might with your sister in friendly fashion live?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That so unto this country might come the Niblung gold:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>If but the queen were friendly, your gain were manifold."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>He said: "We must attempt it; my brothers are with her;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>We'll beg them so to urge her that she be friendlier.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Until at last prevail we that she thereto agree."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Quoth Hagen: " I misdoubt me that that will ever be."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>He presently bade Ortwein unto her court to go</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Likewise the margrave Gere: and both of them did so.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And Giselher the youthful and Gemot, too, they brought.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Who straightway Dame Kriemhilda in friendly wise besought.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>To her the valiant Gemot of Burgundy then said:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Too long hast thou, O Lady, bewail'd thy Siegfried dead!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The king to you will swear that by him he was not slain.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Still day by day one hears thee so bitterly complain."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Said she: " None doth accuse him: 'twas Hagen's hand that slew;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And where he might be stricken from me alone he knew.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>How could I have believed that such hate to him he bore?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>More care would I have taken "—the Queen said furthermore—</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Ere any word of mine had his noble life betray'd:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then little cause for weeping should I, poor wife, have had.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>No more can I have kindness for those who this have done."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then Giselher besought her, the brave and comely one.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>"To greet the king I'm willing," she did at last declare:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With his best friends before her one saw him soon appear.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But Hagen durst at no time within her presence go</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>His guiltiness well knew he; 'twas he who wrought her woe.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Since she her hate to Gunther was willing to forswear,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>'Twould better have beseem'd him to kiss her then and there.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Were 't not that by his counsel her sorrows had been made,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He might have met Kriemhilda with boldness undismay'd.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Ne'er was a reconcilement, when friend by friend was met,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>More tearfully accomplish'd: her sorrow rankled yet.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Save only one amongst them, she pardon'd every one:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He ne'er were slain, if Hagen the murder had not done.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Not very long thereafter they brought it so about</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That unto dame Kriemhilda the mighty hoard came out</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of Niblung-land, and safely was to the Rhine conveyed.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>It was her wedding dowry, and rightly hers was made.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>'Twas Gemot who went for it, and with him Giselher</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And eighty-hundred liegemen, who had commands from her</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To go and fetch the treasure from where it lay unseen,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Since Alberich its keeper, with trusty friends, had been.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Now when they saw the Rhine-men coming the hoard to take,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The ever-valiant Albrich unto his comrades spake:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>"We dare not keep the treasure withholden from her power,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Seeing the noble lady can claim it as her dower.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Yet never would the matter have come to such a pass,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Had we not had," said Albrich, " the evil luck, alas!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The goodly cap of darkness with Siegfried's self to lose:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Which fair Kriemhilda's husband was ever wont to use.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Now evil unto Siegfried hath happen'd since the day</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That from our hands the hero the Tarnhelm took away,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And all this land by conquest did to his service bind."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then went the treasure-keeper straightway the keys to find.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>At the hill-foot were waiting the Queen Kriemhilda's men</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And sundry of her kinsmen; the treasure bore they then</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Down to the lake-shore, lading their vessel with the same:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then o'er the waves they took it and up the Rhine-stream came.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Now may you of this treasure a wondrous story hear:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>It took a dozen wagons it from the mount to bear;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Four days and nights they ceased not to carry it away;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And each must make the journey, so laden, thrice a day.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Naught else but gold and jewels within this treasure lay;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And had one taken from it what would the whole world pay,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>'T would not have seem'd to eyesight of one mark's value quit.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Ay! Not without some reason did Hagen covet it.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The gem of all lay lowest—a little rod of gold.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whoever understood it he might the mastery hold</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In all the world's dominions, o'er every race of men.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of Albrich's kinsmen many did follow Gemot then.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>As soon as they had carried the hoard to Gunther's land,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And thus the queen had taken the whole into her hand,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The storerooms and the towers were full as they could hold.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Never of such vast treasure the marvel hath been told.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>And even were the treasure increased a thousand fold.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And she once more might Siegfried in health and strength behold,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Gladly to him would Kriemhild have empty-handed gone:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For never could a hero a truer wife have won.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Now that she had the treasure, she brought unto the land</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Full many a stranger- warrior; in truth the lady's hand</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Her bounty gave so largely, the like had ne'er been known.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>This queen had many virtues: that all the folk did own.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>To poor men and to wealthy she now began to give</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So much, that Hagen argued: if she perchance should live</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For long enough, 'twas likely so many would she win</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To stay there in her service, that 'twould go ill with him.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>King Gunther said: " Her own are her body and estate;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>What she shall do with either how then can I dictate?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Nay, hardly could I compass that she became thus kind .</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So let both gold and silver go as she hath a mind."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>But to the king said Hagen: " No prudent man and wise</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Would leave to such a woman a treasure of this size.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In gifts we'll see her spend it and squander the whole store,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And then the bold Burgundians may rue it evermore."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then answer'd him king Gunther: " To her an oath I swore</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That I to her would never do any evil more;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And that will I abide by, for she my sister is."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But thereunto said Hagen: " Let me be blamed for this."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The oaths that they had taken they reckon'd all for naught.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And from the widow's keeping the mighty hoard they brought,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And quietly did Hagen of all the keys get hold.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Wroth was her brother Gemot when he the truth was told.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then spake the noble Giselher: " Hagen a deal of ill</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Hath done unto my sister: reckon with him I will.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And were he not my kinsman, 'twould stand him in his life."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then once again to weeping fell Siegfried's widow'd wife.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then up and spake Lord Gemot: " Ere we be troubled aye</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>By reason of this treasure, we'll take it all away</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And sink it in the Rhine-stream; then will it no man's be."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To GiseUier her brother then went she woefully.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>She spake: " Beloved brother, thou must take thought for me;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of both my life and substance the guardian thou shouldst be."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then spake he to the lady: " This will I undertake</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>When we have home returned: we have a ride to take."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The king and all his kinsmen now left their land behind—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The best of all were taken that one therein could find—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>None stay'd save Hagen only; that did he for the hate</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He bore unto Kriemhilda; with purpose did he wait.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Before the mighty king came back to his home again,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Hagen had meanwhile managed the treasure great to gain.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Down in the Rhine at Lochheim he sank it bodily.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He hoped yet to enjoy it: but that was not to be.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The princes came back shortly, and with them many a man.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of her great loss Kriemhilda to make complaint began,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And all her maids and ladies: great was their grief, in sooth.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Ready with faithful service was Giselher the youth.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>They one and all said: " Hagen hath done us a foul wrong."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then from the princes' anger he kept aloof for long,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Till he regained their favour; and so they left him free:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Yet never to Kriemhilda could he more hateful be.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Before Hagen of Tronj had hidden thus the hoard,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They made a pact together and with strong oaths assured,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That it should remain hidden as long as each should live:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>None for himself should take it, nor to another give.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>So now again with sorrow her heart was desolate:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>First for her husband's murder, and now that her estate</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Had all been taken from her. Thus she became a prey</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Unto her grief for ever until her dying day.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>After the death of Siegfried, as verily appears,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With many troubles burthen'd she dwelt for thirteen years;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And all the while could never forget the warrior dead.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>She aye was faithful to him: that all the people said.</span></span>
