			<h2>ADVENTURE II.— SIEGFRIED.</h2>



In Netherland was growing a rich king's son and heir. 
Whose father's name was Siegmund, Sieglind his mother fair. 
In a strong castle lived they, of far and widespread fame, 
Beside the great Rhine river ; and Santen was its name. 

21. 

This prince's name was Siegfried, a gallant knight and good. 
In many kingdoms proved he his brave and warlike mood ; 
So great his strength of body, he rode from land to land. 
Ha ! what fine warriors found he on the Burgundian strand ! 



II.] SIEGFRIED. I 

22. 

In his best days of prowess, when he was young and slim, 
Full many a wondrous story the country told of him, — 

How noble was his stature, how fair he was to see, — 
And many a comely woman look'd on him lovingly. 

23- 
He had a careful rearing, as did his birth befit. 
His virtues were his own, though, and nowise due to it I v^ 
Unto his father's country he was an ornament, 
For men in all things found him to be right excellent. 

24. 
Now was he grown so manly that he to court must ride ; — 
The men-folk saw him gladly ; and dames and maids beside 
Wished that his will might bring him, not once, but ever there;— 
Full many bore him favour, as well the knight was ware ! 

25. 
To ride forth unattended the boy was ne'er allowed. 
In costly raiment decked him Siegmund and Sieglind proud ; 
And the wise elders taught him (as well they understood), 
How best to win the people, and rule the land for good. 

26. 
And being now so stalwart that he could weapons bear, 
Having what he required, enough and e'en to spare, 
He turned his thoughts to women, and dreamt of a fair bride : 
The fairest might stand proudly at the bold Siegfried's side. 

27- 

Then did his father, Siegmund, summon his Hegemen all 
Unto a friendly banquet in the great castle-hall ; 
To many a neighbour-king's land the festal tidings spread ; 
On strangers as on kinsmen steeds, gear, he lavished. 



6 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [aDV. 

28. 
If any squire were lacking knightly estate and name, 
Who, by descent and breeding, had thereunto a claim, 
Such noble youth was bidden to tournament and board. 
And with the young king, later, was girt with knightly sword. 

29. 

One could tell many marvels of this great feast so rare ; 
Siegmund and Siegelinda did win much honour there 
By the good gifts they lavished, with free and open hand ; 
Therefore so many strangers came riding to their land. 

30- 
Four hundred squires received their knightly gear that day. 
Together with young Siegfried ; and maidens fair, they say, 
Toiled at the festal raiment, because they did him hold 
So dear, and many a jewel they broidered in the gold. 

31- 
And wove them in the robe-weft, and stitched upon the hem : 
Sure, to such proud young warriors behoved lace and gem ! 
The host had seats prepared for many a gallant man, 
At that June feast, where Siegfried his knightly course began. 

32. 
And thither to the Minster came many a wealthy squire, 
And many a noble warrior. The elders did aspire 
That day to serve the younger, as was the ancient rule ;— • 
And merriment, and pastime, and joy were at the full. 

33- 
When later, in God's honour, a solemn Mass was sung, 
Up rose from out the people a great and mighty throng, 
Who there received knighthood, with fitting knightly rite. 
And honours, such as ne'ermore were seen of mortal wight. 



II.] SIEGFRIED. 7 

34. 
Soon ran the knights to where they found saddled chargers wait ; 
At Siegmund's court began then a tournament so great 
That one heard hall and palace with crash of arms resound, 
As the high-mettled thanes met upon the tilting-ground. 

35. 
From old knights and from young ones went thrust and parry there, 
Till crash of breaking lances re-echoed through the air ; — 
One saw the splinters flying up to the palace wall 
From many a gallant knight's hand : so eager were they all ! 

36. 

The host he bade them end it ; they led the steeds away ; 
Full many a sturdy buckler to sight all broken lay ; 
And precious stones, in plenty, had fallen on the sward 
From out the shining shield-clasps : the onset was so hard. 

37- 

Then went the host's guests whither they bidden were to sit; 
Their weariness was banished by the choice food they ate, 
And by wine of the rarest, of which there was no stint. 
Alike to friends and strangers was all this lavishment. 

38. 
And, though the games and pastimes had lasted all the day. 
The throngs of merrymakers knew neither rest nor stay. 
Contending for the many good gifts that were to hand : 
A bounty which redounded to the praise of Siegmund's land. 

39- 
Then did the king make over to young Siegfried, the loan 
Of both his lands and castles, as he afore had done. 
Unto his knightly comrades he gave with open hand, , 

So all were right well-pleased that they had sought his land. '' 



8 .THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

40. 
Until the seventh sunrise the festival went on. 
Then did the rich queen, Sieglind, as in old days was done, 
For love of her son Siegfried, share out her red gold free : 
To win all folks' hearts to him thereby, in sooth, hoped she. ' 

41. 

Not one who in the games played, methinks, went poor away ; 
It rained steeds and raiment through all the land that day. 
As if had come the world's end, and common life were o'er ! 
Such gifts, in such abundance, were never known before ; 

42. 
So, with befitting honour, ended the festal day. 
And some of the rich nobles were overheard to say, 
Thatthey would like the young man. Prince Siegfried, fortheir lord ; 
Howbeit the honest Siegfried, gave heed not to their word. 

43- 
While Siegmund and Sieglinda were living, their dear son 
Would never dream of wearing the crown for any one ! 
He wished to be lord only the mighty to restrain, 
Who kept the land in terror, — the bold and gallant thane !
