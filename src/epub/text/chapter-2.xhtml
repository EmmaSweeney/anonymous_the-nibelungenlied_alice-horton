			<h2>Adventure II.— SIEGFRIED.</h2>
			<p>
				<span>In Netherland was growing a rich king's son and heir.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose father's name was Siegmund, Sieglind his mother fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a strong castle lived they, of far and widespread fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside the great Rhine river ; and Santen was its name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This prince's name was Siegfried, a gallant knight and good.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In many kingdoms proved he his brave and warlike mood ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So great his strength of body, he rode from land to land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ha ! what fine warriors found he on the Burgundian strand !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In his best days of prowess, when he was young and slim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full many a wondrous story the country told of him, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How noble was his stature, how fair he was to see, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a comely woman look'd on him lovingly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He had a careful rearing, as did his birth befit.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His virtues were his own, though, and nowise due to it I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto his father's country he was an ornament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For men in all things found him to be right excellent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now was he grown so manly that he to court must ride ; —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The men-folk saw him gladly ; and dames and maids beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wished that his will might bring him, not once, but ever there;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full many bore him favour, as well the knight was ware !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To ride forth unattended the boy was ne'er allowed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In costly raiment decked him Siegmund and Sieglind proud ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wise elders taught him (as well they understood),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How best to win the people, and rule the land for good.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And being now so stalwart that he could weapons bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Having what he required, enough and e'en to spare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He turned his thoughts to women, and dreamt of a fair bride :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fairest might stand proudly at the bold Siegfried's side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then did his father, Siegmund, summon his Hegemen all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto a friendly banquet in the great castle-hall ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To many a neighbour-king's land the festal tidings spread ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On strangers as on kinsmen steeds, gear, he lavished.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If any squire were lacking knightly estate and name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, by descent and breeding, had thereunto a claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such noble youth was bidden to tournament and board.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with the young king, later, was girt with knightly sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One could tell many marvels of this great feast so rare ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Siegmund and Siegelinda did win much honour there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the good gifts they lavished, with free and open hand ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore so many strangers came riding to their land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Four hundred squires received their knightly gear that day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together with young Siegfried ; and maidens fair, they say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toiled at the festal raiment, because they did him hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So dear, and many a jewel they broidered in the gold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And wove them in the robe-weft, and stitched upon the hem :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sure, to such proud young warriors behoved lace and gem !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The host had seats prepared for many a gallant man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At that June feast, where Siegfried his knightly course began.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thither to the Minster came many a wealthy squire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a noble warrior. The elders did aspire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That day to serve the younger, as was the ancient rule ;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And merriment, and pastime, and joy were at the full.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When later, in God's honour, a solemn Mass was sung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up rose from out the people a great and mighty throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who there received knighthood, with fitting knightly rite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And honours, such as ne'ermore were seen of mortal wight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon ran the knights to where they found saddled chargers wait ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Siegmund's court began then a tournament so great</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That one heard hall and palace with crash of arms resound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the high-mettled thanes met upon the tilting-ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From old knights and from young ones went thrust and parry there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till crash of breaking lances re-echoed through the air ; —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One saw the splinters flying up to the palace wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From many a gallant knight's hand : so eager were they all !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The host he bade them end it ; they led the steeds away ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full many a sturdy buckler to sight all broken lay ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And precious stones, in plenty, had fallen on the sward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From out the shining shield-clasps : the onset was so hard.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then went the host's guests whither they bidden were to sit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their weariness was banished by the choice food they ate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by wine of the rarest, of which there was no stint.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alike to friends and strangers was all this lavishment.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, though the games and pastimes had lasted all the day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The throngs of merrymakers knew neither rest nor stay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Contending for the many good gifts that were to hand :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A bounty which redounded to the praise of Siegmund's land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then did the king make over to young Siegfried, the loan</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of both his lands and castles, as he afore had done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto his knightly comrades he gave with open hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So all were right well-pleased that they had sought his land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Until the seventh sunrise the festival went on.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then did the rich queen, Sieglind, as in old days was done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For love of her son Siegfried, share out her red gold free :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To win all folks' hearts to him thereby, in sooth, hoped she.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not one who in the games played, methinks, went poor away ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It rained steeds and raiment through all the land that day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if had come the world's end, and common life were o'er !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such gifts, in such abundance, were never known before ;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, with befitting honour, ended the festal day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some of the rich nobles were overheard to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they would like the young man. Prince Siegfried, fortheir lord ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Howbeit the honest Siegfried, gave heed not to their word.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While Siegmund and Sieglinda were living, their dear son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would never dream of wearing the crown for any one !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He wished to be lord only the mighty to restrain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who kept the land in terror, — the bold and gallant thane !</span>
