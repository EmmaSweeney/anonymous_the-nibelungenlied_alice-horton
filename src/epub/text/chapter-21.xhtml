			<h2>Adventure XXII.— HOW ETZEL ESPOUSED KRIEMHILDA.</h2>

1336. 
Until the fourth day dawning at Traisenmauer she stay'd. 
The dust upon the roadways meanwhile was never laid ; 
It rose, as from some burning, on every side, like smoke, 
While through the Austrian country came riding Etzel's folk. 

1337- 
Meanwhile to the king also the news was duly brought ; 
Whereon his former sorrow soon vanished at the thought 
How royally Kriemhilda across the land did ride. 
The king then made him ready to go and meet his bride. 

1338. 
Strange tongues of many races one heard upon that road, 
As many gallant warriors in front of Etzel rode ; 
Of Christians and of pagans a host exceeding great ; 
And when they met the Lady they went in noble state. 

1339- 
Of Russ and Greek came riding a goodly company, 
And Poles and Wallachs saw one go rushing swiftly by 
Upon their gallant chargers, that mightfuUy they rode ; 
And nothing was there lacking of native use and mode. 

1340. 
From out of the Kief country rode many a warrior bold ; 
And hordes from wild Petschnegen. These did the custom hold 
Of carrying bow and arrow to shoot birds as they flew ; 
With strength they pull'd the bow-string, and the full shaft's length 
drew. 



XXII.] HOW ETZEL ESPOUSED KRIEMHILDA. 229 

1341. 
There stood upon the Danube, in Austrian land, a town 
The name whereof was Tulna : to her was there made known 
Full many a foreign custom she had not seen before. 
By many was she welcomed, who through her suffer'd sore. 

1342. 
As guard before King Etzel a company there rode 
Of mighty men and merry, courtly and high of mood ; 
Of princes four-and-twenty, all great and wealthy men. 
They came to see their Lady, — naught more they ask'd for then. 

1343. 
There also was Duke Ramung, from the Wallachian plain, 
Who with seven hundred horsemen before her sped amain : 
Like birds of passage flying, one saw them whirling by. 
Prince Gibeche soon follow'd, with stately chivalry. 

1344. 
Hornboge, the aye ready, came with a thousand men, 
And from the king's side turn'd him towards his Lady then. 
As was their country's custom, they raised a mighty shout. 
And all the Hunnish kinsmen in swarms came riding out. 

1345- 
Also there came from Denmark Haward the valiant one, 
And ever-ready Iring, to falseness all unknown ; 
And Irnfried of Thuringia, a goodly man was he ! 
So welcomed they Kriemhilda, she needs must honour'd be. 

1346. 
With their twelve hundred liegemen the host they rode before. 
Sir Bloedelin came also with thrice a thousand more — 
The brother of King Etzel from out of Hungary : 
Right royally escorted unto the queen rode he. 



230 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1347- 
And last of all King Etzel ; and with him Dietrich came 
With all his chosen comrades and many a knight of fame, 
Right noble and praiseworthy, and valiant and good. 
Whereat was dame Kriemhilda much lightsomer of mood. 

1348. 
Then, to the princess speaking, the nobler Riideger 
Said : " Lady, I will welcome the mighty sovran here. 
And whomsoe'er I bid you to kiss, so do it then : 
You must not give like greeting to all of Etzel's men." 

1349- 
Then down from off her palfrey the high-born queen they took ; 
Whereon the mighty Etzel no more delay could brook. 
He from his steed dismounted with many a bold knight too : 
And then one saw him blithely towards Kriemhilda go. 

1350- 
Two rich and mighty princes, as has to us been told, 
Were standing near the lady her garment's train to hold. 
What time the royal Etzel went forward her to meet. 
The noble prince with kisses then did she kindly greet. 

1351- 
She raised the veil that screen'd her ; her dainty colour glow'd 
Out of its golden setting ; and many a knight avow'd 
That ne'er could Lady Helka have shown a face more fair. 
King Etzel's brother, Bloedelin, was standing very near. 

1352. 
Him Riideger the margrave bade her to kiss ; and eke 
King Gibeche ; and Dietrich, who was not far to seek. 
A dozen of the warriors were kiss'd by Etzel's bride ; 
Then gave she other greeting to many a knight beside.

1353- 
Now all the while that Etzel did by Kriemhilda stay 
The younger men were busy (as such would be to-day) 
With many mighty tiltings ; one saw then how they rode ; 
Both Christian knights and heathen, each following their mode. 



1354- 
How knightly was the bearing of Dietrich's gallant men ! 
Their javelins and lances went flying forth amain 
High over shields and bucklers, by good knights' hands address'd, 
Then shiver'd were the shield-rims of many a German guest. 

1355- 
Then was a mighty crashing of breaking lance and spear. 
The warriors of the country were all assembled there, 
As were the king's guests also, — a throng of noble men : 
The mighty king was walking with dame Kriemhilda then. 

1356. 
They saw hard by them standing a very noble tent ; 
The plain around was cover'd by many a wooden pent, 
Where folk might sit and rest them when work was duly sped ; 
And many beauteous maidens by heroes there were led 

1357. 
Unto their royal mistress, as she was sitting there 
Upon the rich chair covers. The margrave right good care 
Had taken, so to fit it, that everyone should find 
Kriemhilda's bower delightful : and glad was Etzel's mind. 

1358. 
What Etzel spake unto her it is not mine to say. 
Meanwhile her small white fingers within his right hand lay. 
In loving fashion sat they, for knightly Riideger 
Would have no secret wooing betwixt the king and her. 



232 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1359- 
Straightway commands were given that all the games be stay'd ; 
With honour they were ended and all the din allay'd. 
Into the wooden houses the men of Etzel hied ; 
And folk provided lodging around for far and wide. 

1360. 
The day had reached its ending : they laid them down to sleep 
Until the light of morning again began to peep. 
Then were the steeds bestridden once more, by many a man : 
Ha, and in Etzel's honour what pastimes then began ! 

1361. 
The king enjoin'd his Hunsmen to do all honour bade. 
Unto Vienna city their way from Tuln they made ; 
There, deck'd in fine apparel, full many a dame they fomid ; 
King Etzel's wife these welcomed, as in all honour bound. 

1362. 
In all-suf¥icing plenty whatever they would have 
Was there, already for them. Right many a warrior brave 
With joy the sport awaited. All went to hostelry. 
And soon the royal wedding began right merrily. 

1363- 
But not for all could lodgings be found within the town. 
To such as were not strangers, did Riideger make known 
That they must seek out quarters in country places round. 
I ween there were at all times near dame Kriemhilda found 

1364. 
Dietrich, the noble warrior, and many another thane. 
These, in their work unresting, but little peace mote gain 
Till nothing should be lacking to cheer the strangers' mood. 
So Riideger and his comrades had rest and pastime good. 



XXII.] HOW ETZEL ESPOUSED KRIEMHILDA. 233 

1365- 
The marriage was accomplish'd one day in Whitsuntide, 
When first the royal Etzel lay by Kriemhilda's side, 
Within Vienna's city. So many men, thought she, 
At her first husband's bidding, she surely ne'er did see. 

1366. 
To those who had not seen her she made herself well known 
By gifts ; yea many among them unto the guests did own : 
"We deemed that dame Kriemhilda had little goods or gold, — 
But here hath she, by giving, wrought marvels manifold." 

1367. 

The merry-making lasted for days full seventeen. 
And never was there told of another king, I ween. 
Whose wedding was more noble : such is to us unknown. 
All folk who there were present did new apparel own. 

1368. 
In Netherland, aforetime, thought she, she ne'er had sat 
With such a throng of warriors. I say, moreover, that, 
If great was Siegfried's substance, he ne'er had, as his men, 
So many noble warriors as stood round Etzel then. 

1369. 
Nor was there ever any who at his wedding-tide 
Of mantles gave so many, so rich and deep and wide ; 
Nor any such good raiment as here there was to don. 
In honour of Kriemhilda was all in this wise done. 

1370. 
Their friends and eke the strangers were all alike of mind, 
That there had been no sparing in gear of any kind. 
Whatever any wanted, that presently he had. 
Yea many a knight through kindness was wellnigh naked made. 



234 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1371. 

Yet days of old in Rhineland she could not quite forget, 
Beside her noble husband ; and then her eyes grew wet. 
She did her best to hide it, lest anyone should see. 
After so many a sorrow much honour now had she. 

1372. 
What others gave in bounty no better was than air 
Compared with Dietrich's giving. Whatever Botlung's heir 
Had given him for largesse, that quickly lavish'd he. 
Eke Riideger with bounty was marvellously free. 

1373- 

And Bloedelin came also, the prince from Hungary, 
And bade men take whatever in many chests might be 
Of gold and silver pieces : 'twas all to give away. 
Then saw one the king's heroes keeping high holiday. 

1374. 
The players of King Etzel, Warbel and Swemmelin, 
I ween that either of them did at the wedding win 
A thousand marks for certain, or maybe even more. 
What time the fair Kriemhilda her crown by Etzel wore. 

1375- 

Upon the eighteenth morning they from Vienna went. 
Then was in knightly pastime full many a buckler bent, 
By lances that were carried in every warrior's hand. 
Soon came the royal Etzel unto the Hunnish land. 

1376. 
In the old town of Heimburg they rested overnight. 
By then the throng of people could no one tell aright. 
Nor with what strength of numbers they overspread the ground. 
Ay me, and what fair women they in his country found ! 



XXII.] HOW ETZEL ESPOUSED KRIEMHILDA. 235 

1377- 

At Miesenburg the wealthy unto the boats they took. 
The stream with men and horses was hidden, as to look 
Not otherwise than dry land ; yet ever seem'd to flow. 
The women, travel-weary, had ease and comfort now. 

1378. 
Together had been fasten'd ships many and right good, 
That they might get no damage from either waves or flood ; 
And many a well-made awning thereover did they strain, 
As if they still beneath them had land and open plain. 

1379- 
At Etzelburg, before them, arrived these tidings then. 
Whereat was great rejoicing of women and of men. 
The ladies of Queen Helka, who erewhile were her care, 
Soon many days and happy did with Kriemhilda share. 

1380. 
There stood and waited for her full many a noble maid, 
On whom abundant sorrow since Helka's death had weigh'd. 
The daughters of kings seven still there Kriemhilda found, 
Who were the pride and glory of Etzel's land around. 

1381. 
The maiden lady Herrat, still of them all had care, 
Queen Helka's sister's daughter, of many virtues rare. 
The bride betroth'd of Dietrich, child of a king of fame, 
The daughter, too, of Nentwein : to honour great she came. 

1382. 
Unto the guests' arrival she look'd with mood right glad, 
Whereto great stores and treasure were also ready made. 
How later the king feasted — who could it all declare ? 
And with a queen at no time did Hunsmen better fare. 



236 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1383. 
As with his wife beside him the king rode from the strand, 
The noble dame Kriemhilda was given to understand 
The name of every lady, the better them to greet. 
Ay, mightily she bore her sitting in Helka's seat. 

1384. 
To her was faithful service render'd right readily. 
Wherefore the queen divided her gold and jewelry, 
Her silver and apparel : whatever she did convey 
From over Rhine to Hunsland must all be given away. 

1385. 
Also with suit and service subject to her, from then, 
Were all of the king's kinsmen, and likewise all his men. 
Never had Lady Helka enjoy 'd such potent sway ; 
So must they serve Kriemhilda until her dying day. 

1386. 
Then stood so high in honour the court and realm around, 
That men came there at all times, and chosen pastime found, — 
To whatsoe'er it might be that each one's heart did lean, — 
Be it the king's good favour or bounty of the queen.
