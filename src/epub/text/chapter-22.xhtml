			<h2>ADVENTURE XXIII.— HOW KRIEMHILDA THOUGHT TO AVENGE HER INJURY.</h2>

1387. 
In great estate of honour, as truly doth appear, 
They dwelt with one another until the seventh year. 
During this time the king's wife brought forth a son and heir ; 
Whereat the royal Etzel could ne'er be happier. 



XXIII.] HOW KRIEMHILDA THOUGHT TO AVENGE HER. 237 

1388. 
She would not be persuaded to be content with aught 
But that the child of Etzel should to the font be brought, 
With Christian rites according. Ortlieb they named the boy : 
Which all through Etzel's country was cause of mickle joy. 

1389. 
Whatever noble virtues in Lady Helka lay, 
To match them dame Kriemhilda aye studied, day by day. 
The customs soon were taught her, by Herrat, maid forlorn, 
Who with a secret longing for Helka still did mourn. 

1390. 
To native folk and strangers she now was widely known : 
'Twas said of her, that never did any king's land own 
A better, milder mistress ; right sure of this they were. 
Such fame she bore in Hunsland until the thirteenth year. 

1391. 
Now since she knew for certain that none would her gainsay 
E'en as kings' warriors mostly their princes' wives obey, — 
And as twelve kings before her were ever seen to come, 
She thought on all the sorrows that she had known at home. 

1392. 
She thought, too, of the honours that once in Niblungland 
Had been in her possession ; and which by Hagen's hand. 
At time of Siegfried's murder, were wholly done away : 
And whether he might ever for that be made to pay. 

1393- 
" It might be, could I bring him by some means to this land." 
She dreamt that she was walking, and near her, close at hand, 
Was Giselher, her brother, and in her gentle sleep 
She kissed him very often. He soon had cause to weep ! 



238 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1394. 
I ween some evil devil Kriemhilda did provoke 
That with her brother Gunther her friendship now she broke, 
Whom she, in full forgiveness, kiss'd on Burgundian soil. 
Then with hot tears began she once more her robe to spoil 

1395- 
And ever, late and early, within her heart it wrought 
How, without fault on her part, she had thereto been brought, 
That henceforth with a heathen she must in wedlock live ; 
This bitterness did Hagen and Gunther, too, contrive. 

1396. 
The wish that dwelt within her ne'er let her heart alone ; 
Thought she : " I am so mighty, and such great riches own. 
That on my foes in vengeance some ill I may repay. 
Thus would I do right gladly to Hagen of Tronje. 

1397. 

" My heart is longing sorely for my dear faithful one : 
Might I but get them near me who ill to me have done, 
So would I take full vengeance for my beloved's life ;— 
Scarce can I bide their coming ; " so murmur'd Etzel's wife. 

1398. 
The whole of the king's liegemen held highly in esteem 
The warriors of Kriemhilda : and well it was, I deem. 
Her treasurer was Eckwart, — good friends thereby he made. 
Nor could Kriemhilda's wishes by any be gainsaid, 

1399- 
Now was she ever thinking : " I will beseech the king ! " 
To wit, that of his goodness he would allow this thing, 
That unto the Hun-country her kinsmen might be brought 
But no one there discover'd the queen's unholy thought.

1400. 
It came to pass one night-time, as by the king she lay, 
(His arms were cast about her, as was his wont alway, 
Loving the noble lady : for she was as his life) 
That of her foes was thinking the fair and noble wife. 



1401. 
And to the king thus spake she : " My ever dear good lord, 
I fain would ask a favour, if thou wouldst such accord : 
If I am worthy of it, that thou shouldst let me see 
Whether my friends and kinsmen thou lovest verily." 

1402. 
Then spake the mighty sovran, and guileless was his mood : 
" I would have thee believe that, if any grace or good 
Be done unto those warriors, I must thereat be glad, 
Since I by love of woman ne'er better friends have made." 

1403. 
And yet again the queen spake : " To thee it hath been said. 
That I have high-born kinsmen ; and this my grief hath made 
That they have never troubled to come to see me here. 
I hear the people call me naught else but foreigner." 

1404. 
Whereunto answer'd Etzel : " Beloved lady mine, 
If not too far it seemeth, so will I from the Rhine 
Bid all unto my kingdom whom thou art fain to see." 
When thus she learnt his purpose right glad at heart was she. 

1405. 
She said : " If thou right truly wouldst serve me, master mine, 
So wilt thou send an envoy to Worms beyond the Rhine. 
That I may tell my kinsfolk all that I have in mind. 
Then many a knight right noble his way to us shall find." 



240 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1406. 
" Whenever thou commandest," said he, " it shall be done. 
Thou canst not be so eager thy friends to look upon 
As I of noble Ute the sons to see am fain ; 
That we are still such strangers hath caused me mickle pain. 

1407. 
" And if it should content thee, beloved lady mine. 
So will I send right gladly, unto those friends of thine, 
My players on the fiddle to the Burgundian land." 
To bring the worthy fiddlers straightway he gave command. 

1408. 
They hasten'd very quickly to where King Etzel sat. 
And eke the queen beside him. He told them both, how that 
As envoys they were chosen to Burgundy to fare. 
For them he bade his people rich raiment to prepare. 

1409. 
For four-and-twenty warriors was new apparel made ; 
And by the king their errand was also to them said : 
How Gunther and his people to bring there they should seek. 
But fain was Lady Kriemhild apart with them to speak. 

1410. 
Then said the king most mighty : " Now hark ye what to do ! 
All that is good and kindly I bid my friends, by you ; 
If they vouchsafe to journey unto my kingdom here. 
Ne'er yet have I had knowledge of guests as these so dear. 

1411. 
" And if they so be minded my will herein to do, 
These kinsmen of Kriemhilda, then must they not forego 
To come to us this summer, to keep my wedding-feast ; 
For much on my wife's kindred my happiness doth rest."

1412. 
Then spake the fiddle-player, the haughty Schwemmelin : 
" When will in this your kingdom your wedding-feast begin ? 
That we to your friends yonder unerringly may say." 
Then answer made King Etzel : *' On next Midsummer-day " 

1413- 
" We'll do as thou dost bid us," made answer Werbelin. 
Then gave the queen an order that they be brought within 
Her private room in secret, to speak with her alone. 
Whereof soon many a warrior but sorry comfort won. 

1414. 
To both the envoys spake she : " Well shall it be for you 
If you my will and purpose right faithfully shall do, 
And say whate'er I bid you when to my home you go ; 
In goods I'll make you wealthy, and raiment rich bestow. 

1415- 
" What friends of mine soever ye see and meet with there 
At Worms on the Rhine river, take heed lest ye declare 
That ye have ever seen me in melancholy mood : 
And bear my greeting unto those heroes bold and good. 

1416. 
*' To what the king requireth beg them that they agree, 
And thereby let them make me from all my trouble free. 
The Huns may well believe that I have no friends at all. 
Were I a knight, I'd ever be ready at their call. 

1417, 
" And to my noble brother, to Gemot eke say ye 
That in the world is no one I hold more lovingly : 
Our best of friends and kinsmen bid him unto this land 
To bring, that so the better we may in honour stand.

1418. 
" To Giselher say also that he must not forget 
That never have I suffer'd by fault of his as yet : 
Wherefore would I right gladly set eyes on him again ; 
And, for the faith he show'd me, to see him here am fain. 

1419. 

" And also tell my mother what honours now I bear. 

If Hagen, too, of Tronj^ shall still be dwelling there 

By whom shall they more fitly be through the country shown ? 

To him the roads to Hunsland from childhood have been known." 

1420. 
Unknowing were the envoys what meaning therein lay. 
That Hagen, knight of Tronje, on no account should stay 
Behind the rest in Rhineland. Soon woe for them it made : 
With him was many a warrior to cruel death betray'd. 

1421. 

With message and with letters they were provided now : 
To live henceforth in plenty of wealth they had enow. 
Their leave they took of Etzel and of his lady fair. 
And clad in rich apparel a goodly sight they were.
