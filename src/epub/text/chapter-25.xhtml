			<h2>ADVENTURE XXVI.— HOW GELFRAT WAS SLAIN BY DANKWART.</h2>

1586. 
When they were all come over unto the further strand, 
The king began to question : " Who will throughout this land 
Show us the proper pathways, — lest we should stray afar ? " 
Then spake the valiant Volker : ** Alone for that I'll care." 

1587. 
" Now bide ye yet," said Hagen, " if squire you be or knight, 
A friend's word should be follow'd ; that seems to me but right. 
I have unwelcome tidings to make known unto ye : 
No more shall we return to the land of Burgundy 1

1588. 
** To-day, at early morning, told me mermaidens two, 
That we should home return not. Now rede I what to do : 
Look to your weapons, heroes, ye needs must well beware ; 
Here have we mighty foemen, and warily must fare. 

1589. 
" I thought to catch her lying, that wily mermaiden : 
She swore that none among us should ever come again 
Alive unto our country, except the priest alone : 
Whom therefore I this morning have done my best to drown." 

1590. 
Then quickly flew these tidings, from troop to troop they spread ; 
From the keen heroes' faces for grief the colour fled ; 
To sorrow then began they that this court-ride should lead 
To bitter death as ending : in sooth, they had good need. 

1591- 
Nigh Moeringen the place was where they the flood had cross'd. 
The ferryman of Else there, too, his life had lost. 
And thereupon said Hagen : " Seeing that I have made 
Foes on the road, I doubt not that we shall be waylaid. 

1592. 
" To-day that self-same boatman at early dawn I slew ; 
Ye know right well the story. Now buckle quickly to, 
That if this day should Gelfrat or Else here essay 
To fall upon our people, they shall the damage pay. 

1593- 
*' For such bold men I know ye, this cannot fail to be. 
'Twere well to let your horses, therefore, go quietly, 
That none should deem we're passing along the roads in flight." 
" That counsel will I follow," said Giselher the knight.

1594. 

" But who shall now our people across the country show ? " 
They answer'd : " That shall Volker, for right well doth he know 
The highways and the byways, a gallant minstrel he." 
Before their wish was utter'd, the fiddler they could see 

1595- 
Standing well-arm'd before them. He bound his helmet on, 
And on his battle-mantle the glorious colour shone. 
As signal, on a lance-shaft, a pennon red he bore. 
But with the kings, thereafter, he fell on trouble sore. 

1596. 
Meanwhile the boatman's murder became to Gelfrat known 
By message all undoubted ; and eke the news had gone 
To Else the most mighty; and sore aggrieved were they. 
They sent to call their chieftains, who came without delay. 

1597. 
In space of time the shortest, — I would to you make known, — 
Were seen unto them riding men, who erewhile had done 
Sore scathe and dread achievements in direst stress of war. 
Of such there came to Gelfrat seven hundred men or more. 

1598. 
Their foemen fierce to challenge to ride they then began, 
Led by their lords aforesaid. Too readily they ran 
To catch the doughty strangers and wipe away their shame. 
Of their retainers many by death thereafter came. 

1599- 
Meanwhile, Hagen of Tronje for that had taken care ; 
(How could a hero better for all his friends beware ?) 
Together with his liegemen the watch by night kept he, 
As did his brother Dankwart : 'twas done right prudently.

1600. 
The day its course had ended and light they had no more. 
He fear'd for friends and comrades with heavy dread and sore. 
Their road throughout Bavaria beneath their shields they track'd. 
And ere they long had ridden the heroes were attack'd. 

1601. 
On both sides of the roadway behind them, coming fast, 
They heard the tramp of horse-hoofs, too noisy in their haste. 
Then spake the gallant Dankwart : " Here will they fall on us ! 
Now fasten on your helmets, — 'twere wise to wait them thus." 

1602. 
They halted on their journey, naught else was to be done. 
They saw how in the darkness the polish'd bucklers shone, 
Until at last would Hagen no longer brook delay : 
" Who hunts us on the highway ? " to him must Gelfrat say. 

1603. 
In this wise then the Margrave — he of Bavaria — spake : 
*' Our foemen we are seeking, and now are on their track. 
I know not who hath slain me my ferryman this day, 
He was a skilful hero, and sorrow well I may." 

1604. 
To him spake he of Tronje : " And was that boatman thine ? 
He would not take us over. The guilt thereof is mine, 
For then I slew the warrior ; in sooth, there was good need, 
Since at his hands I elsewise had got my death instead. 

1605. 
" I offer'd him for guerdon good gold and raiment fine 
To ferry us, O hero ! unto this land of thine, 
Which anger'd him so sorely that he at me a blow 
Aim'd with a sturdy barge-pole ; then I grew fierce enow, 

T

1606. 
" And clutching at my broadsword, I paid him back again 
With blows that deeply wounded ; so was the hero slain. 
Amends therefore I'll make thee, howe'er thou thinkest good." 
Then fell the two to wrangle : both were of stubborn mood. 

1607. 
** Full well I knew," said Gelfrat, " that when this way did ride 
Gunther and his retainers, much ill would us betide 
Through Hagen, lord of Tronje. Not hence ahve goes he ; 
For my poor boatman's murder he must the forfeit be." 

1608. 
Above their bucklers bent they their lances for the thrust, 
Sir Gelfrat and Sir Hagen ; each at the other must. 
Then Else, too, and Dankwart came riding gallantly, 
To try each other's mettle ; the fight raged fiercely. 

1609. 
How otherwise might heroes more featly try their strength ? 
By a hard lance-thrust smitten Hagen the bold, at length. 
From off his horse fell backwards, by Gelfrat's hand laid low 
His saddle-bow was broken and downfall he must know. 

1610. 
Among the yeomen's lances arose a clashing sound. 
Then up again rose Hagen, who, whilom on the ground 
From Gelfrat's blow, had fallen upon the meadow-grass. 
His mood, methinks, to Gelfrat of sort ungentle was. 

1611. 
Who held in charge their horses, that is to me unknown ; 
The twain were now dismounted and on the sand stood down, — 
Hagen, to wit, and Gelfrat, who at each other flew ; 
The folk of either aided who of the combat knew. 



XXVI.] HOW GELFRAT WAS SLAIN BY DANKWART. 27$ 

1612. 
How mightfully soever Hagen on Gelfrat leapt, 
The noble margrave parried ; and with one stroke he swept 
A great piece off his buckler, — that sparks therefrom were shed ; 
Whereby King Gunther's vassal was wellnigh stricken dead. 

1613. 
Thereon he unto Dankwart to call aloud began : 
" Dear brother, help me quickly ! for, lo, a mighty man 
Hath got me at his mercy ; he'll make an end of me ! " 
Then spake the valiant Dankwart : "To that I soon will see." 

1614. 
Then nearer sprang the hero and struck so fell a blow 
With keen edge of his weapon, that dead he laid him low. 
Then fain had Else taken some vengeance for the wight ; 
But he and all his people went off in sorry plight. 

1615. 
His brother had been slaughter'd ; himself, too, had a wound ; 
Full eighty of his warriors lay there upon the ground 
In grim Death's grip forever ; needs must the hero then 
Turn round and flee for safety before King Gunther's men. 

1616. 
Now while they of Bavaria along the road did flee, 
The horrid sounds of slaughter were heard unceasingly. 
So did the men of Tronje after their foemen chase. 
Who of defeat had dreamt not ; too soon it came to pass. 

1617. 
And while they still were fleeing, Dankwart the thane call'd out : 
" Upon the road right quickly we ought to turn about 
And let them run at leisure : all wet they are with blood ! 
Unto our friends return we ; in sooth I deem it good." 



2/6 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1618. 
Now when they were returned to where the fight had been, 
Spake Hagen, lord of Tronj^ : " Ye heroes, be it seen 
What damage we have suffer'd, and who to us is lost ; 
By reason of this battle which Gelfrat's wrath hath cost." 

1619. 

A loss of four they reckon'd ; these must they grieve for well. 
But fully they aveng'd were : for against them there fell 
Of the Bavarian warriors a hundred men and more ; 
Whereby the Tronians' bucklers were dimm'd and wet with gore. 

1620. 
Just then a gleam of moonlight between the clouds did break. 
" Now look ye well that no one," so to them Hagen spake, 
" Betray to my dear masters what we have done this day ; 
Let them until the morning free from all trouble stay." 

1621. 
When they who had been fighting had now caught up the rest, 
With weariness the people were grievously distressed. 
" How long," were many asking, " must we be riding yet ? " 
And doughty Dankwart answer'd : "No lodging can we get. 

1622. 
*' Until the dawn of morning ye all must onwards ride." 
Volker the quick, who all things did for the folk provide, 
Bade some one ask the marshal : "Where shall we go towards, 
That we may rest our horses and eke our well-loved lords ? " 

1623. 
Then spake the doughty Dankwart : " In sooth I cannot say, 
But there must be no resting before the dawn of day ; 
Then, wheresoe'er we find it, upon the grass we'll lie." 
Some, when they heard this bidding, were sore aggrieved thereby.

1624. 
So were they undiscover'd by the warm blood-stains red, 
Until the sun uprising with his bright beams had shed 
The day-dawn o'er the mountains ; then first the king did see 
That they had fought. The hero spake to them wrathfuUy : 

1625. 
" How now? ye have, friend Hagen, methinks but small regard 
For this my presence with you, seeing ye thus have dared 
To stain with blood your armour ! now who hath done this 

thing ? " 
" 'Twas Else, who set on us last night," he told the king. 

1626. 
" His ferryman the cause was that we were set upon ; 
My brother came, and Gelfrat was by his hand fordone ; 
Then Else fled before us, by direst need bested. 
Four men we lost ; a hundred of them we left for dead." 

1627. 
The place at which they rested I know not to declare ; 
But all the country people ere long became aware 
That sons of noble Ute to court were on their way : 
And thus a hearty welcome at Passau soon had they. 

1628. 
The Bishop Pilgrin, uncle of these high rulers three, 
Was in his heart well-pleased his sister's sons to see, 
With such a host of warriors, thus come to his domain. 
That he meant well unto them, was very quickly plain. 

1629. 
Right gladly were they welcomed by friends upon the way ; 
But since there was at Passau no room for them to stay. 
They needs must cross the water, where open field they found; 
There tents and wooden cabins they set up on the ground. 



2/8 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1630. 
There must they stay and rest them for space of one whole day 
And eke the night that follow'd. How fairly served were they ! 
To Riideger's dominions thence had they to ride on. 
To him the tidings also were very quickly known. 

1631. 
When now the wayworn riders had taken needful rest, 
And nearer were approaching the country of their quest, 
They found upon the marches a knight who sleeping lay, 
From whom Hagen of Tronje a stout sword took away. 

1632. 
Ay, Eckewart the name was of that same warrior good ; 
Much grief had he thereover, and sorry was his mood 
That he had lost the weapon through heroes passing there. 
lU-watch'd found they the borders of margrave Riideger. 

1633. 

" Woe 's me for this dishonour," thereon said Eckewart, 
" This journey of Burgundians I rue with all my heart. 
Since ever I lost Siegfried, my luck hath all been gone. 
Alack, the day, Lord Riideger, what ill to thee I've done ! ** 

1634. 
Now Hagen heard right plainly the noble warrior's woe. 
His sword again he gave him and six red armlets, too. 
" Take these as pledge, O hero, that thou my friend wilt be ; 
Good knight thou art, though lonely thou sleptst upon the lea." 

1635- 

*' God for thy rings requite thee," said Eckewart thereto ; 
"Thy journey into Hunsland yet sorely do I rue. 
Thou took'st the life of Siegfried ; here art thou held in hate. 
To guard thyself be careful : in good faith rede I that."

1636. 
*' Now God alone must keep us ! " Hagen for answer gave. 
" In truth no greater trouble these warriors now have 
Than that, for kings and liegemen, on lodgings we may light, 
Where we in this same country may lay our heads to-night. 

1637. 
** The horses have been ruin'd by roads so far about ; " 
Thus spake the warrior Hagen, " our stores are all run out ; 
None can be had for money ; a worthy host we need, 
Who ere this day is ended will kindly give us bread." 

1638. 
Spake Eckewart in answer : " A host to you I'll show : 
And such a one ne'er bade you into his house to go, 
In any land whatever, as ye may meet with here 
If ye, good thanes are willing to visit Riideger. 

1639. 

"He dwells hard by the highway : of hosts he is the best 
That ever had a rooftree. His heart is aye possest 
Of kindness, as of flowers are meadows in sweet May ; 
If he can succour heroes, glad will he be the day." 

1640. 
** Wilt thou then," said King Gunther, " be now my messenger. 
And see if for my pleasure, my kind friend Riideger 
Shelter unto my kinsfolk and all our men will give ? 
So will I do my utmost to serve him while I live." 

1641. 
"I'll gladly be the envoy," then answer'd Eckewart. 
With right good will so did he upon the errand start. 
To Riideger declared he what he was bade to say. 
Who no such joyful tidings had heard for many a day. 



280 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1642. 
Folk saw to Bechelaren a knight ride hastily. 
Him Riideger himself saw : " On yonder road," said he, 
" Comes Eckewart fast riding, of Kriemhild's lieges one." 
He fancied that the foemen some harm to him had done. 

1643. 
Then went he to the gateway where he the envoy found 
Who laid aside his weapon from off his belt unbound. 
The message that he carried he sought not to withhold 
From host and friends about him ; but straight his story told. 

1644. 
Unto the margrave spake he : "I come at the command 
Of Gunther, king and ruler of the Burgundian land, 
And Giselher his brother, and likewise Gemot, too ; 
Each of these warriors sendeth his greeting unto you. 

1645. 
" The like doth also Hagen, as Volker doth as well. 
With true and ready service. And more I have to tell : 
That — as the royal marshal sends word to you by me — 
The good men much are needing your hospitality." 

1646. 
With smiling lips unto him made Riideger reply : 
" Glad am I at your tidings, that kings so great and high 
Deign to bespeak my service : they shall not be denied. 
If they will cross my threshold 'twill give me joy and pride." 

1647. 

" Dankwart the marshal likewise begs you by me to tell 
If you can furnish house-room for all the rest as well : 
For sixty valiant warriors, a thousand knights right good, 
And men-at-arms nine thousand?" Then joyful was his mood. 



XXVII.] HOW THEY CAME TO BECHELAREN. 28 1 

1648. 
" Now be these guests right welcome," made answer Riideger, 
" And all these noble warriors, unto my dwelling here ; 
To them, as yet, at no time have I a service done. 
So ride to meet them, kinsmen and lieges everyone." 

1649. 
Then quickly to their horses hurried each squire and knight. 
Whate'er their master bade them to all of them seem'd right ; 
And they in service hasted the readier for that. 
Naught wist yet dame Gotlinda, who in her chamber sat.
