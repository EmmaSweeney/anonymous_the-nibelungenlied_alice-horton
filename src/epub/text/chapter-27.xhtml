			<h2>ADVENTURE XXVIII— HOW THE BURGUNDIANS CAME TO ETZEL'S STRONGHOLD</h2>

1718. 
As soon as the Burgundians were come to Hunnish land, 
Of Bern ^ a chieftain heard it, — the aged Hildebrand. 
Unto his lord he told it ; to him 'twas all unmeet ; 
Yet bade he them with kindness the valiant knights to greet. 

1719. 

The ready Wolf hart bade them to bring the horses out. 
Then rode along with Dietrich full many a warrior stout, 
As towards the open country to welcome them he went. 
There had they pitch'd already full many a noble tent. 

1720. 
When Hagen, lord of Tronje, them from afar espied, 
Unto his masters turning, in courteous words he cried : 
" Now, please ye, gallant warriors, dismount on to your feet, 
And them whom you would welcome go forth yourselves to meet. 

1721. 
*' The company that cometh is right well known to me : 
They are the doughty warriors from Amelung country. 
And he of Bern doth lead them ; they are of courage high. 
'Twere better not to flout them when folk to serve ye try." 

1722. 
Then down from horse alighted (as was indeed but right) 
All they who came with Dietrich, full many a squire and knight. 
They walk'd towards the strangers, where they the chiefs could 

see. 
And courteously greeted the men of Burgundy.

1723. 
When noble Dietrich saw them their way towards him make, 
Perchance ye fain would hearken to what the warrior spake 
Unto the sons of \Jt6. Their journey grieved him sore : 
The truth, he thought, Sir Riideger had known and told before. 

1724. 
" Be welcome, sirs, right welcome, Gunther and Giselher, 
And Gemot, too, and Hagen ; and, not the less, Volker 
And swift and ready Dankwart ! Have ye not understood 
That o'er her Niblung hero Kriemhilda yet doth brood ? " 

1725- 
" Then let her brood for ever ! " Hagen in answer said, 
" For many a long year is it since he was stricken dead. 
To love the King of Hunsland is now her duty plain : 
Siegfried hath long been buried ; he comes not back again." 

1726. 
" Now let us, an' it please you, leave Siegfried's wounds alone ; 
Whilst Dame Kriemhilda liveth evil may still be done." 
So did the noble Dietrich, the knight of Bern, declare. 
*' Thou Mainstay of the Niblungs, to guard thyself beware ! " 

1727. 
*' And wherefore should I guard me ? " the high-born king replied ; 
" Tidings we had from Etzel (what should I ask beside ?) 
That, came we hither riding, 'twould give him much content 
My sister Kriemhild, likewise, hath many a message sent." 

1728. 
" If I may give you counsel," so Hagen to them spake, 
" Beg that the noble Dietrich and his good warriors make 
Some better declaration of what they have in mind. 
And tell us to what humour Dame Kriemhild is inclined."

1729. 
Then the three mighty chieftains to speak apart withdrew, 
Gunther to wit, and Gemot, and the lord Dietrich, too : 
" Now, knight of Bern, pray tell us, thou noble warrior good, 
What of the queen thou knowest, and what may be her mood. 

1730. 
The knight of Bern made answer : " What can I tell you more ? 
I hear her ev'ry morning weeping and wailing sore, — 
This wedded wife of Etzel — in manner piteous. 
To the great God of Heaven, for stalwart Siegfried's loss." 

i73i- 
" It may not be averted," — that boldest man declared, 
Volker, the fiddle-player, — ** the doom whereof we've heard ; 
To court we're bound to journey, there for ourselves to see 
What fate for us good warriors among the Huns shall be." 

1732. 
So hence the bold Burgundians to court rode on their way 
After their country's fashion, in glorious array. 
And many a bold man marvell'd among the Hunfolk there 
At Hagen, lord of Tronj6, what kind of man he were. 

1733- 
For since was told the story, (that was enough alone,) 
How he the Netherlander Siegfried to death had done, — 
The stoutest of all warriors, the husband of Kriemhild — 
With questions about Hagen the court was wellnigh fill'd. 

1734- 
Of goodly growth and presence the hero was, no doubt ; 
Broad-shouldered and deep-chested ; his hair was fleck'd about 
With streaks of grisly colour ; long in the shank was he, 
And stony was his visage ; he walk'd right royally.

1735- 
Then quarters were appointed for the Burgundian men. 
The whole of Gunther's followers were sunder'd from him then. 
This by the queen was compass'd, with hatred for him fill'd ; 
Hence all the yeomen, later, were in their hostel kill'd. 

1736. 
Since Dankwart, Hagen's brother, the marshal had been made, 
The king with zeal commended the men to him ; and bade 
That he would seek their comfort and let them have their fill. 
This chief of the Burgundians bore all of them goodwill. 

1737- 
And now came Queen Kriemhilda with all her company 
That she might greet the Niblungs with feigned courtesy. 
But Giselher, her brother, she kiss'd and took his hand. 
This Hagen saw, and tighter he laced his helmet's band. 

1738. 
"In view of such a greeting," thus Hagen blurted out, 
" A prompt and ready warrior may well have some misdoubt ! 
To kings and to their vassals greetings unlike befall : 
We've made no lucky journey to this high festival." 

1739- 
" To those who fain would see thee," said she, " now welcome be : 
Thou shalt not have a greeting for friendship's sake from me. 
Say what it is thou bringest from Worms beyond the Rhine, 
That thou so great a welcome shouldst have from me and mine." 

1740. 
" If I had heard the tidings," so Hagen spake again, 
"That you for gifts were looking at hands of every thane. 
Had I myself been wealthy I would have twice bethought 
Or ever to this country my gifts for you I brought." 



XXVIII.] HOW THEY CAME TO ETZEL'S STRONGHOLD. 297 

1741. 
" 'Tis rather you, who tidings to me should give : to wit, 
The Nibelungen treasure, what have ye done with it ? 
It was mine own possession, and that right well you knew : 
'Twas this ye should have brought me to Etzel's land with you.*' 

1742. 
" I' faith, my Lady Kriemhild, 'tis now full many a day 
Since when at my disposal the Niblung treasure lay ; 
At bidding of my masters 'twas sunk in the Rhine-tide : 
There till the Day of Judgment, in sooth, it may abide." 

1743. 
Then spake the queen in answer : " 'Tis even as I thought ! 
Right little of it have you for me to this land brought. 
Although 'twas mine, and whilom within my power it lay ; 
Since when I've spent thereover full many a dreary day." 

1744. 
" The devil a bit I bring you ! " Sir Hagen fell to swear : 
" I have my shield to carry, and that 's enough to bear, 
Together with my mail-coat ; my helm 's a trifling thing, 
My sword I have in hand though, so naught for you I bring." 

1745- 
Thereon the queen spake loudly unto those warriors all : 
" Let no man any weapon carry into the hall ; 
Give them to me, ye heroes, I'll keep them safe for you ! " 
"Nay, by my troth," cried Hagen, "that will we never do ! 

1746. 
" I covet not the honour, gentle princess and fair. 
That thou unto the hostel my shield thyself shouldst bear. 
Nor other of my weapons : thou hast a queen become ; 
So taught me not my father; I will be chambergroom." 



298 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1747- 
" O woe on all my sorrow ! " Kriemhilda loudly said, 
" How is it that my brother and Hagen are afraid 
To leave their shields in keeping ? They have been warn'd, I see ; 
And knew I who had done it, I'd give him death for fee." 

1748. 
Thereon Lord Dietrich answer'd, and said to her in scorn : 
" 'Twas I that took upon me these noble kings to warn ; 
And Hagen warn'd I likewise, the brave Burgundian. 
Come on, thou devil's daughter, do me the worst you can ! " 

1749. 
Ashamed and sore confounded at this was Etzel's wife : 
For bitterly with Dietrich she feared to be at strife. 
She found no word to answer, but went away in haste, 
Whilst but a few sharp glances upon her foes she cast. 

1750- 
Then hand by hand two warriors took each of other hold : 
The one was noble Dietrich, the other Hagen bold. 
Then spake in courtly manner that knight of spirit high : 
*' Your coming to the Hunfolk doth grieve me, verily, 

1751- 
" Seeing the queen hath spoken such words to you but now." 
Then Hagen spake, of Tronje : " 'Twill matter not, I trow." 
In such wise with each other, parley'd the two brave men. 
Meanwhile King Etzel saw them, and fell to questioning then. 

1752. 
" I would that some one told me," the mighty sovereign said, 
" Who is that warrior yonder, to whom Sir Dietrich bade 
So heartily a welcome ? Of courage high is he ; 
Whoever were his father, a hero must he be ! "

1753. 
Then one of Kriemhild's liegemen to answer him began : 
" He is by birth of Tronje, his sire was Aldrian. 
How blithe so e'er he bears him, he hath a spirit grim. 
You shall yourself discover I tell no lies of him." 

1754- 
" How shall I have occasion to know he is so stern ? " 
(The many sly devices as yet he had to learn, 
Wherewith, to catch her kinsmen, the queen sought to contrive 
That none of them from Hunsland again might come alive.) 

1755- 
" Well knew I that same Aldrian, a liegeman of mine own, 
And here with me he won him much honour and renown. 
'Twas I a knight who dubb'd him, and gave him of my gold ; 
My faithful Helka bore him much kindness, too, of old. 

1756. 
" And all, by that same token, of Hagen know I well. 
Into my hands for hostage two goodly children fell, 
He and the Spanish Walther ; who being to manhood bred, 
I sent back Hagen ; Walther with Hildegunda fled." 

1757. 
He thought of the old stories and all that happ'd of yore, 
His olden friend of Tronj^ he gladly saw once more. 
Who in his youth good service to him ne'er fail'd to lend. 
Soon he in age repaid him by death of many a friend.
