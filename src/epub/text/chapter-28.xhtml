			<h2>Adventure XXIX.— HOW HE STOOD NOT UP BEFORE HER.</h2>

1758. 
This famous pair of warriors asunder then withdrew, 
Hagen, the lord of Tronje, and noble Dietrich, too. 
Whereon across his shoulder look'd Gunther's man around 
In hope to see a comrade, whom in a trice he found ; 

1759- 
For there Sir Volker standing by Giselher he saw ; 
He begg'd that cunning minstrel aside with him to draw, 
For well was he acquainted with his unyielding mood. 
In sooth, he was in all points a warrior bold and good. 

1760. 
They left the lords together standing in the courtyard. 
'Twas seen how they twain only, and not another, fared 
Across the court wide-stretching before a palace great ; 
Those chosen men of valour had fear of no man's hate. 

1761. 
They sat upon a settle against the palace front, 
Hard by a hall which Kriemhild herself to use was wont. 
Brightly upon their bodies their noble raiment shone, 
And plenty who beheld them would gladly them have known. 

1762. 
Like wild beasts of the forest those haughty heroes then 
Were gaped upon and gazed at by all the Hunnish men. 
The wife of Etzel spied them athwart a window-pane : 
Whereby the fair Kriemhilda was sorely grieved again.

1763. 
It brought to mind her sorrow ; she fell to weeping then, 
Whereat was mickle marvel among King Etzel's men : 
What could have thus so quickly troubled their lady's mood ? 
She answer'd : " That hath Hagen, ye heroes bold and good." 

1764. 
They spake unto the lady : " How can this thing have been 
When we ourselves but lately have you so happy seen ? 
None can have been so hardy such evil to have wrought : 
Else bid us to avenge it ; his life shall go for naught." 

1765. 
" For ever would I serve him who would my wrongs repay, 
To give him all he ask'd for I would be ready aye. 
Upon my knees I beg you," so spake the royal wife, 
" Avenge me now on Hagen, that he may lose his life." 

1766. 
Then sixty gallant warriors girded their armour on, 
Who, for the love of Kriemhild, were keen to set upon 
And make an end of Hagen — the ever valiant one — 
And likewise of the minstrel. 'Twas all with forethought done. 

1767. 
But when the queen beheld them, how small a band they made, 
In grim and gloomy humour she to the heroes said : 
*' Ye must leave unaccomplish'd what ye would take in hand : 
Ay, never against Hagen so few will dare to stand ! 

1768. 
" How strong and bold soever Hagen of Tronj^ be. 
The man who sits beside him is stronger far than he, 
Volker, the fiddler, namely ; he is an evil wight. 
These heroes to encounter ye will not find so light." 



302 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1769. 
When they had heard this warning still more took heart of grace, — 
Four hundred gallant warriors. That queen of noble race 
Had set her heart upon it to do her foes despite : 
Whence soon was mickle sorrow made ready for each knight. 

1770. 
Now when she saw her liegemen with arms and armour clad, 
Unto the ready warriors the noble lady bade : 
" Abide ye here a little, ay, stand ye quiet so ; 
I mean to put my crown on, and to my foemen go. 

1771. 
" And hark while I upbraid him for what he did to me. 
This Hagen, lord of Tronje, King Gunther's knight in fee. 
So arrogant I know him, he'll give me not the lie ; 
And eke care I as little what he shall get thereby." 

1772. 
Then look'd the fiddle-player, the minstrel bold, and lo. 
He saw the noble lady along a stairway go. 
That led down from the palace. And when he that espied, 
The ever valiant Volker unto his comrade cried : 



1773. 
" Now look ye there, friend Hagen, how yonder cometh nigh 
She who into this country hath lured us faithlessly. 
With king's wife saw I never so many men around. 
Bearing in hand their weapons, as for a battle bound. 

1774- 
" Know'st thou, friend Hagen, whether they hatred to thee bear? 
If so, I fain would counsel that thou the better care 
Shouldst take of life and honour : ay, that, methinks, were good ! 
Unless I am mistaken, they are in wrathful mood. 



XXIX.] HOW HE STOOD NOT UP BEFORE HER. 303 

1775- 
"And some there are among them so exceeding broad of breast 
That who would rest in surety hath little time to waste. 
I ween, beneath their clothing, their hauberks bright they wear ; 
But whom therewith they threaten I nowise can declare." 

1776. 
Then spake in mood of anger Hagen, the valiant one : 
*' For me, right well I know it, the whole of this is done, — 
That thus their unsheath'd weapons they carry in the hand ; 
Yet will I, notwithstanding, ride to Burgundian land ! 

1777. 
*' Now say if thou, friend Volker, thine aid to me wilt lend, 
If so be Kriemhild's liegemen to fight with me intend ? 
That let me hear you promise, as I am dear to you ; 
And evermore I'll answer to you with service true." 

1778. 
" Ay, surely will I help thee," the gallant minstrel spake : 
" Saw I a king come hither, attack on us to make 
With all his warriors round him, so long as I should live 
I would not fail to help thee, and not a foot would give." 

1779. 
" Thy service, noble Volker, may God in Heaven requite. 
What further can I ask for, if thou by me wilt fight ? 
Since thou art fain to aid me, as I am glad to hear. 
These blades may come and welcome with all their warlike gear." 

1780. 
" Now from the seat upstand we," then said the man of song : 
" She is a sovereign lady ; and let her pass along. 
Let us that honour pay her, she is of noble birth. 
Thereby our own condition shall seem of greater worth." 



304 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1781. 
" For love of me, I pray thee, do it not," Hagen spake : 
" Lest otherwise these warriors perchance the deed mistake 
And think that I had risen, through fear, upon my feet. 
For such as her and her kind I'll never leave my seat ! 

1782. 
" For both of us 'twere better, methinks, to let it be. 
Why should I do her honour who bears such hate to me ? 
Nay, that will I do never as long as I have life ; 
Nor care I for the hatred of royal Etzel's wife ! " 

1783. 
The overweening Hagen across his knees laid down 
A bare and shining weapon, upon whose pommel shone 
A very brilliant jasper, greener than any sward. 
Kriemhilda well remember'd that it was Siegfried's sword. 

1784. 
When she that sword remember'd a grief it needs must be ; 
The hilt of it was golden, its sheath red broidery. 
It brought to mind her sorrow ; her tears began to fall ; 
I ween the hardy Hagen had therefor done it all. 

1785. 
Upon the bench towards him the valiant Volker drew 
A fiddle-bow, a strong one, and long and mighty, too, 
Which to a sword had likeness, right keen and broad of blade 
The pair of doughty heroes thus sat there undismay'd. 

1786. 
The valiant twain so lordly seem'd, in their own conceit. 
They did not deem it fitting to stand up from their seat 
For fear of man or woman. Whereon, with foe-like mien, 
Nigh to their feet, to greet them, came up the noble queen. 



XXIX.] HOW HE STOOD NOT UP BEFORE HER. 305 

1787. 
She spake : " Now tell me, Hagen, who sent to bid you here, 
That riding in our country thou darest to appear ? 
Thou, too, who so well knowest what thou hast done to me ? 
Hadst thou been well advised thou best hadst let it be." 

1788. 
*' No one hath sent to fetch me," Hagen in answer said : 
" But hither to this country three warriors you bade ; 
My masters they are called, to them I service owe. 
On any royal journey I scarce could fail to go." 

1789. 
Said she : " Now tell me further, how was it thou didst that 
For which thou hast deserved my everlasting hate ? 
Thou was it who didst Siegfried, my well-loved husband, slay ; 
Whom I must mourn for ever until my dying day." 

1790. 
He spake : " What boots that further ? Of talk we have no need. 
I am that self-same Hagen who did to death Siegfried, 
The mighty-handed hero. How dearly he repaid 
The flouts which Dame Kriemhilda on fair Brunhilda laid ! 

1791. 
*' It is not to be doubted, O great and mighty queen, 
Of all your baleful sorrows that I have guilty been. 
Now be it man or woman, let them avenge who will ; 
Though I should then gainsay you, I've done you grievous ill." 

1792. 
Said she : " Now hark ye, warriors, he doth not e'en deny • 
That he hath work'd my sorrow ! What may befall thereby 
To him, ye men of Etzel, of no account I hold." 
Then look'd on one another those haughty thanes and bold.

1793- 
It doubtless had befallen, whichever had begun 
The strife, that these two comrades the honour would have won ; 
Seeing how oft in battle they gallantly had fought. 
In dread the others shrank from the deed they had in thought. 

1794. 
Then spake one of the warriors : " Why look ye so on me ? 
From what I erewhile promised I would that I were free ! 
For sake of no one's largesse would I forego my life. 
Ay ! to our ruin go we, led by King Etzel's wife." 

1795. 
Whereafter spake another : " To that same thought I hold ; 
Were anyone to give me whole towers of good red gold, 
I'd care not to contend with that fiddler willingly, 
For dread of the swift glances that in his eyes I see. 

1796. 
" Hagen have I known also, and from his early youth : 
Thus little can be told me about that knight, forsooth ! 
In two-and-twenty battles I've seen him, in the strife ; 
Whereby hath heartfelt sorrow befallen many a wife. 

1797. 
" On many a foray went they, he and the Spaniard, 
When they were here with Etzel ; ofttimes a battle hard 
They fought for the king's honour ; and many such befell ; 
Whereof one must of Hagen much to his honour tell. 

1798. 
" At that time this same warrior was but a child in years. 
They who were then but youngsters, how gray are now their hairs ! 
Now he is come to wisdom, a man of ruth is he. 
And eke he wieldeth Balmung, won by foul treachery." 



XXIX.] HOW HE STOOD NOT UP BEFORE HER. 307 

1799. 
With that the thing was settled, — that none should strike a blow. 
Whereby the queen was stricken unto the heart with woe. 
The heroes all disbanded : fearful lest death indeed 
Be dealt them by the fiddler : in sooth they had good need. 

1800. 
Then spake anon the fiddler : " We have right plainly seen 
That foemen here beset us, as we forewarn'd have been. 
Now to the court return we and seek the sovrans there : 
That no one, then, our masters to meet in strife may dare. 

1801. 
** How oft a man, faint-hearted, will let a chance slip by, 
When if a friend beside him upheld him cheerfully 
And with good understanding, he would not do the same. 
Right many a man by forethought is saved from loss and shame." 

1802. 
"Where you go I will follow," Hagen was quick to say; 
Then back into the courtyard forthwith they took their way, 
Where still in grand assembly waited the knightly crowd. 
And then the valiant Volker began to speak aloud 

1803. 
And say unto his masters : " How long here will ye stay 
To let yourselves be crowded ? To court ye should away, 
And from the king discover what he in mind may have." 
Then might one see forgather the heroes good and brave. 

1804. 
The prince of Bern, Sir Dietrich, took hold of by the hand 
Gunther, the mighty ruler of the Burgundian land. 
Irnfried was fain with Gemot, that right bold man, to fare, 
And Riideger went walking to court with Giselher. 



308 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1805. 
Howe'er the rest companion'd, and so to court pass'd on, 
Betwixt Volker and Hagen of parting there was none, 
Save only in one struggle, which ended their two lives, 
And caus'd sad weeping later to many noble wives. 

1806. 
Upon the kings attending one saw to court go then 
Their nobly-born retainers, a thousand gallant men ; 
And sixty warriors also along with them had come ; 
The same that valiant Hagen had brought with him from home. 

1807. 
And Haward eke and Iring, a pair of chosen worth, 
By one another walking, went with the sovrans forth. 
Dankwart and also Wolf hart, a thane of courage rare ; 
These well before the others upheld their honour there. 

1808. 
When came the lord of Rhineland within the palace door, 
Etzel, the mighty monarch refrained himself no more, 
But from his seat upsprang he, seeing him entering, 
A better greeting never was given by a king. 

1809. 
" Be welcome, my lord Gunther, and you, lord Gemot, too, 
And Giselher, your brother. My zealous service true, 
I have already sent you to Worms beyond the Rhine. 
And all your followers also shall welcome be as mine. 

1810. 

" I bid a hearty welcome to you, ye knightly pair. 
To Volker the right valiant and eke to Hagen there, 
From me and from my lady, unto this land of mine. 
She messengers in plenty hath sent ye to the Rhine.**

1811. 
Hagen of Tronje answered : " So heard I, more than once ! 
And had I for my masters not come unto the Huns, 
Yet would I you to honour have ridden to this land." 
The noble host then kindly his guests took by the hand ; 

1812. 
And to the seat he brought them where he himself had sat, 
Then to the guests they offer'd (they busily did that), 
In wide-mouth'd golden goblets, wine, mead and mulberry, 
And bade to the newcomers a welcome heartily. 

1813. 
Then spake the royal Etzel : "I will to you confess 
Naught in this world could give me a greater happiness 
Than ye have given me, heroes, in coming thus to me , 
Whereby the queen is also from mickle grief set free. 

1814. 
" And ofttimes have I marvell'd what was the fault in me — 
So many guests right noble have I been wont to see — 
That ye unto my country to come did never deign ? 
But now that I have seen you to joy is turn'd my pain.'* 

1815. 
Said Riideger in answer (a knight of noble mood) : 
" Well may you see them gladly ; their faith indeed is good, 
And all my lady's kinsfolk the same can well uphold ; 
They bring unto your palace full many a warrior bold." 

1816. 
The even of Midsummer, at mighty Etzel's court 
These princes made their entry ; and seldom hath report 
Told of such royal welcome as on these chiefs he spent. 
Now was it time for eating ; and all to table went. 



3IO THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

1817. 
Amidst his guests more nobly a host ne*er took his seat. 
For them there was abundance whereof to drink and eat, 
And everything they wanted it was all ready made ; 
For truly of these heroes great marvels had been said.
