			<h2>Adventure XXVIII— HOW THE BURGUNDIANS CAME TO ETZEL'S STRONGHOLD</h2>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as the Burgundians were come to Hunnish land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Bern ^ a chieftain heard it, — the aged Hildebrand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto his lord he told it ; to him 'twas all unmeet ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet bade he them with kindness the valiant knights to greet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The ready Wolf hart bade them to bring the horses out.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then rode along with Dietrich full many a warrior stout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As towards the open country to welcome them he went.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There had they pitch'd already full many a noble tent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Hagen, lord of Tronje, them from afar espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto his masters turning, in courteous words he cried :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Now, please ye, gallant warriors, dismount on to your feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And them whom you would welcome go forth yourselves to meet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' The company that cometh is right well known to me :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are the doughty warriors from Amelung country.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he of Bern doth lead them ; they are of courage high.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Twere better not to flout them when folk to serve ye try."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then down from horse alighted (as was indeed but right)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All they who came with Dietrich, full many a squire and knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They walk'd towards the strangers, where they the chiefs could see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And courteously greeted the men of Burgundy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When noble Dietrich saw them their way towards him make,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance ye fain would hearken to what the warrior spake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the sons of \Jt6. Their journey grieved him sore :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The truth, he thought, Sir Riideger had known and told before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Be welcome, sirs, right welcome, Gunther and Giselher,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gemot, too, and Hagen ; and, not the less, Volker</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swift and ready Dankwart ! Have ye not understood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That o'er her Niblung hero Kriemhilda yet doth brood ? "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Then let her brood for ever ! " Hagen in answer said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" For many a long year is it since he was stricken dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To love the King of Hunsland is now her duty plain :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Siegfried hath long been buried ; he comes not back again."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now let us, an' it please you, leave Siegfried's wounds alone ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whilst Dame Kriemhilda liveth evil may still be done."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So did the noble Dietrich, the knight of Bern, declare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' Thou Mainstay of the Niblungs, to guard thyself beware ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' And wherefore should I guard me ? " the high-born king replied ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Tidings we had from Etzel (what should I ask beside ?)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, came we hither riding, 'twould give him much content</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My sister Kriemhild, likewise, hath many a message sent."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" If I may give you counsel," so Hagen to them spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Beg that the noble Dietrich and his good warriors make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some better declaration of what they have in mind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tell us to what humour Dame Kriemhild is inclined."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the three mighty chieftains to speak apart withdrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gunther to wit, and Gemot, and the lord Dietrich, too :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Now, knight of Bern, pray tell us, thou noble warrior good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What of the queen thou knowest, and what may be her mood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The knight of Bern made answer : " What can I tell you more ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hear her ev'ry morning weeping and wailing sore, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This wedded wife of Etzel — in manner piteous.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the great God of Heaven, for stalwart Siegfried's loss."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" It may not be averted," — that boldest man declared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Volker, the fiddle-player, — ** the doom whereof we've heard ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To court we're bound to journey, there for ourselves to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What fate for us good warriors among the Huns shall be."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So hence the bold Burgundians to court rode on their way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After their country's fashion, in glorious array.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a bold man marvell'd among the Hunfolk there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Hagen, lord of Tronj6, what kind of man he were.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For since was told the story, (that was enough alone,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How he the Netherlander Siegfried to death had done, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stoutest of all warriors, the husband of Kriemhild —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With questions about Hagen the court was wellnigh fill'd.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of goodly growth and presence the hero was, no doubt ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broad-shouldered and deep-chested ; his hair was fleck'd about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With streaks of grisly colour ; long in the shank was he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stony was his visage ; he walk'd right royally.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then quarters were appointed for the Burgundian men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole of Gunther's followers were sunder'd from him then.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This by the queen was compass'd, with hatred for him fill'd ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hence all the yeomen, later, were in their hostel kill'd.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Since Dankwart, Hagen's brother, the marshal had been made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The king with zeal commended the men to him ; and bade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he would seek their comfort and let them have their fill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This chief of the Burgundians bore all of them goodwill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now came Queen Kriemhilda with all her company</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she might greet the Niblungs with feigned courtesy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Giselher, her brother, she kiss'd and took his hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Hagen saw, and tighter he laced his helmet's band.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"In view of such a greeting," thus Hagen blurted out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" A prompt and ready warrior may well have some misdoubt !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To kings and to their vassals greetings unlike befall :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We've made no lucky journey to this high festival."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" To those who fain would see thee," said she, " now welcome be :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt not have a greeting for friendship's sake from me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Say what it is thou bringest from Worms beyond the Rhine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou so great a welcome shouldst have from me and mine."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" If I had heard the tidings," so Hagen spake again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"That you for gifts were looking at hands of every thane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had I myself been wealthy I would have twice bethought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or ever to this country my gifts for you I brought."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" 'Tis rather you, who tidings to me should give : to wit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Nibelungen treasure, what have ye done with it ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was mine own possession, and that right well you knew :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Twas this ye should have brought me to Etzel's land with you.*'</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" I' faith, my Lady Kriemhild, 'tis now full many a day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since when at my disposal the Niblung treasure lay ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At bidding of my masters 'twas sunk in the Rhine-tide :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There till the Day of Judgment, in sooth, it may abide."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the queen in answer : " 'Tis even as I thought !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right little of it have you for me to this land brought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although 'twas mine, and whilom within my power it lay ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since when I've spent thereover full many a dreary day."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" The devil a bit I bring you ! " Sir Hagen fell to swear :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" I have my shield to carry, and that 's enough to bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together with my mail-coat ; my helm 's a trifling thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My sword I have in hand though, so naught for you I bring."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereon the queen spake loudly unto those warriors all :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Let no man any weapon carry into the hall ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give them to me, ye heroes, I'll keep them safe for you ! "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"Nay, by my troth," cried Hagen, "that will we never do !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" I covet not the honour, gentle princess and fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou unto the hostel my shield thyself shouldst bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor other of my weapons : thou hast a queen become ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So taught me not my father; I will be chambergroom."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" O woe on all my sorrow ! " Kriemhilda loudly said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" How is it that my brother and Hagen are afraid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To leave their shields in keeping ? They have been warn'd, I see ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knew I who had done it, I'd give him death for fee."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereon Lord Dietrich answer'd, and said to her in scorn :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" 'Twas I that took upon me these noble kings to warn ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Hagen warn'd I likewise, the brave Burgundian.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come on, thou devil's daughter, do me the worst you can ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ashamed and sore confounded at this was Etzel's wife :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For bitterly with Dietrich she feared to be at strife.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She found no word to answer, but went away in haste,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whilst but a few sharp glances upon her foes she cast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then hand by hand two warriors took each of other hold :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The one was noble Dietrich, the other Hagen bold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then spake in courtly manner that knight of spirit high :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' Your coming to the Hunfolk doth grieve me, verily,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Seeing the queen hath spoken such words to you but now."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Hagen spake, of Tronje : " 'Twill matter not, I trow."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In such wise with each other, parley'd the two brave men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meanwhile King Etzel saw them, and fell to questioning then.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" I would that some one told me," the mighty sovereign said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Who is that warrior yonder, to whom Sir Dietrich bade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So heartily a welcome ? Of courage high is he ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whoever were his father, a hero must he be ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then one of Kriemhild's liegemen to answer him began :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" He is by birth of Tronje, his sire was Aldrian.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How blithe so e'er he bears him, he hath a spirit grim.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You shall yourself discover I tell no lies of him."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" How shall I have occasion to know he is so stern ? "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(The many sly devices as yet he had to learn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewith, to catch her kinsmen, the queen sought to contrive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That none of them from Hunsland again might come alive.)</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Well knew I that same Aldrian, a liegeman of mine own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here with me he won him much honour and renown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Twas I a knight who dubb'd him, and gave him of my gold ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My faithful Helka bore him much kindness, too, of old.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" And all, by that same token, of Hagen know I well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into my hands for hostage two goodly children fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He and the Spanish Walther ; who being to manhood bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I sent back Hagen ; Walther with Hildegunda fled."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He thought of the old stories and all that happ'd of yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His olden friend of Tronj^ he gladly saw once more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who in his youth good service to him ne'er fail'd to lend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon he in age repaid him by death of many a friend.</span>
