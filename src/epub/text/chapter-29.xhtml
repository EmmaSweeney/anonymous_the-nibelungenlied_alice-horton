			<h2>Adventure XXIX.— HOW HE STOOD NOT UP BEFORE HER.</h2>
			<p>
				<span>This famous pair of warriors asunder then withdrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hagen, the lord of Tronje, and noble Dietrich, too.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereon across his shoulder look'd Gunther's man around</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In hope to see a comrade, whom in a trice he found ;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For there Sir Volker standing by Giselher he saw ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He begg'd that cunning minstrel aside with him to draw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For well was he acquainted with his unyielding mood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In sooth, he was in all points a warrior bold and good.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They left the lords together standing in the courtyard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Twas seen how they twain only, and not another, fared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the court wide-stretching before a palace great ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those chosen men of valour had fear of no man's hate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They sat upon a settle against the palace front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard by a hall which Kriemhild herself to use was wont.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brightly upon their bodies their noble raiment shone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And plenty who beheld them would gladly them have known.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Like wild beasts of the forest those haughty heroes then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were gaped upon and gazed at by all the Hunnish men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wife of Etzel spied them athwart a window-pane :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby the fair Kriemhilda was sorely grieved again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It brought to mind her sorrow ; she fell to weeping then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat was mickle marvel among King Etzel's men :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What could have thus so quickly troubled their lady's mood ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She answer'd : " That hath Hagen, ye heroes bold and good."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They spake unto the lady : " How can this thing have been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When we ourselves but lately have you so happy seen ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None can have been so hardy such evil to have wrought :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else bid us to avenge it ; his life shall go for naught."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" For ever would I serve him who would my wrongs repay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To give him all he ask'd for I would be ready aye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon my knees I beg you," so spake the royal wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Avenge me now on Hagen, that he may lose his life."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then sixty gallant warriors girded their armour on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, for the love of Kriemhild, were keen to set upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make an end of Hagen — the ever valiant one —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And likewise of the minstrel. 'Twas all with forethought done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the queen beheld them, how small a band they made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In grim and gloomy humour she to the heroes said :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' Ye must leave unaccomplish'd what ye would take in hand :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, never against Hagen so few will dare to stand !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" How strong and bold soever Hagen of Tronj^ be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The man who sits beside him is stronger far than he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Volker, the fiddler, namely ; he is an evil wight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These heroes to encounter ye will not find so light."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they had heard this warning still more took heart of grace, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Four hundred gallant warriors. That queen of noble race</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had set her heart upon it to do her foes despite :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence soon was mickle sorrow made ready for each knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now when she saw her liegemen with arms and armour clad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the ready warriors the noble lady bade :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Abide ye here a little, ay, stand ye quiet so ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I mean to put my crown on, and to my foemen go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" And hark while I upbraid him for what he did to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Hagen, lord of Tronje, King Gunther's knight in fee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So arrogant I know him, he'll give me not the lie ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke care I as little what he shall get thereby."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then look'd the fiddle-player, the minstrel bold, and lo.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw the noble lady along a stairway go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That led down from the palace. And when he that espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ever valiant Volker unto his comrade cried :</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now look ye there, friend Hagen, how yonder cometh nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She who into this country hath lured us faithlessly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With king's wife saw I never so many men around.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bearing in hand their weapons, as for a battle bound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Know'st thou, friend Hagen, whether they hatred to thee bear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If so, I fain would counsel that thou the better care</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst take of life and honour : ay, that, methinks, were good !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unless I am mistaken, they are in wrathful mood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"And some there are among them so exceeding broad of breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That who would rest in surety hath little time to waste.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I ween, beneath their clothing, their hauberks bright they wear ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But whom therewith they threaten I nowise can declare."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake in mood of anger Hagen, the valiant one :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' For me, right well I know it, the whole of this is done, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thus their unsheath'd weapons they carry in the hand ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet will I, notwithstanding, ride to Burgundian land !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' Now say if thou, friend Volker, thine aid to me wilt lend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If so be Kriemhild's liegemen to fight with me intend ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That let me hear you promise, as I am dear to you ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And evermore I'll answer to you with service true."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Ay, surely will I help thee," the gallant minstrel spake :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Saw I a king come hither, attack on us to make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all his warriors round him, so long as I should live</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would not fail to help thee, and not a foot would give."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Thy service, noble Volker, may God in Heaven requite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What further can I ask for, if thou by me wilt fight ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since thou art fain to aid me, as I am glad to hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These blades may come and welcome with all their warlike gear."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now from the seat upstand we," then said the man of song :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" She is a sovereign lady ; and let her pass along.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us that honour pay her, she is of noble birth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereby our own condition shall seem of greater worth."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" For love of me, I pray thee, do it not," Hagen spake :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Lest otherwise these warriors perchance the deed mistake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And think that I had risen, through fear, upon my feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For such as her and her kind I'll never leave my seat !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" For both of us 'twere better, methinks, to let it be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why should I do her honour who bears such hate to me ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, that will I do never as long as I have life ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor care I for the hatred of royal Etzel's wife ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The overweening Hagen across his knees laid down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A bare and shining weapon, upon whose pommel shone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A very brilliant jasper, greener than any sward.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kriemhilda well remember'd that it was Siegfried's sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When she that sword remember'd a grief it needs must be ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hilt of it was golden, its sheath red broidery.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It brought to mind her sorrow ; her tears began to fall ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I ween the hardy Hagen had therefor done it all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the bench towards him the valiant Volker drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fiddle-bow, a strong one, and long and mighty, too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which to a sword had likeness, right keen and broad of blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pair of doughty heroes thus sat there undismay'd.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The valiant twain so lordly seem'd, in their own conceit.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They did not deem it fitting to stand up from their seat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For fear of man or woman. Whereon, with foe-like mien,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nigh to their feet, to greet them, came up the noble queen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake : " Now tell me, Hagen, who sent to bid you here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That riding in our country thou darest to appear ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou, too, who so well knowest what thou hast done to me ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hadst thou been well advised thou best hadst let it be."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' No one hath sent to fetch me," Hagen in answer said :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" But hither to this country three warriors you bade ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My masters they are called, to them I service owe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On any royal journey I scarce could fail to go."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Said she : " Now tell me further, how was it thou didst that</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which thou hast deserved my everlasting hate ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou was it who didst Siegfried, my well-loved husband, slay ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom I must mourn for ever until my dying day."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake : " What boots that further ? Of talk we have no need.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am that self-same Hagen who did to death Siegfried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mighty-handed hero. How dearly he repaid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flouts which Dame Kriemhilda on fair Brunhilda laid !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' It is not to be doubted, O great and mighty queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all your baleful sorrows that I have guilty been.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now be it man or woman, let them avenge who will ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though I should then gainsay you, I've done you grievous ill."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Said she : " Now hark ye, warriors, he doth not e'en deny •</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he hath work'd my sorrow ! What may befall thereby</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To him, ye men of Etzel, of no account I hold."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then look'd on one another those haughty thanes and bold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It doubtless had befallen, whichever had begun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The strife, that these two comrades the honour would have won ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing how oft in battle they gallantly had fought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In dread the others shrank from the deed they had in thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake one of the warriors : " Why look ye so on me ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From what I erewhile promised I would that I were free !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For sake of no one's largesse would I forego my life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay ! to our ruin go we, led by King Etzel's wife."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whereafter spake another : " To that same thought I hold ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were anyone to give me whole towers of good red gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'd care not to contend with that fiddler willingly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For dread of the swift glances that in his eyes I see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Hagen have I known also, and from his early youth :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus little can be told me about that knight, forsooth !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In two-and-twenty battles I've seen him, in the strife ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby hath heartfelt sorrow befallen many a wife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" On many a foray went they, he and the Spaniard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they were here with Etzel ; ofttimes a battle hard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fought for the king's honour ; and many such befell ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof one must of Hagen much to his honour tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" At that time this same warrior was but a child in years.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They who were then but youngsters, how gray are now their hairs !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now he is come to wisdom, a man of ruth is he.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke he wieldeth Balmung, won by foul treachery."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With that the thing was settled, — that none should strike a blow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby the queen was stricken unto the heart with woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heroes all disbanded : fearful lest death indeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be dealt them by the fiddler : in sooth they had good need.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake anon the fiddler : " We have right plainly seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That foemen here beset us, as we forewarn'd have been.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now to the court return we and seek the sovrans there :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That no one, then, our masters to meet in strife may dare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>** How oft a man, faint-hearted, will let a chance slip by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When if a friend beside him upheld him cheerfully</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with good understanding, he would not do the same.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right many a man by forethought is saved from loss and shame."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"Where you go I will follow," Hagen was quick to say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then back into the courtyard forthwith they took their way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where still in grand assembly waited the knightly crowd.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then the valiant Volker began to speak aloud</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And say unto his masters : " How long here will ye stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To let yourselves be crowded ? To court ye should away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the king discover what he in mind may have."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then might one see forgather the heroes good and brave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The prince of Bern, Sir Dietrich, took hold of by the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gunther, the mighty ruler of the Burgundian land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Irnfried was fain with Gemot, that right bold man, to fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Riideger went walking to court with Giselher.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Howe'er the rest companion'd, and so to court pass'd on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixt Volker and Hagen of parting there was none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save only in one struggle, which ended their two lives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And caus'd sad weeping later to many noble wives.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the kings attending one saw to court go then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their nobly-born retainers, a thousand gallant men ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sixty warriors also along with them had come ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The same that valiant Hagen had brought with him from home.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Haward eke and Iring, a pair of chosen worth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By one another walking, went with the sovrans forth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dankwart and also Wolf hart, a thane of courage rare ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These well before the others upheld their honour there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When came the lord of Rhineland within the palace door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Etzel, the mighty monarch refrained himself no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But from his seat upsprang he, seeing him entering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A better greeting never was given by a king.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Be welcome, my lord Gunther, and you, lord Gemot, too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Giselher, your brother. My zealous service true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have already sent you to Worms beyond the Rhine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all your followers also shall welcome be as mine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" I bid a hearty welcome to you, ye knightly pair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Volker the right valiant and eke to Hagen there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From me and from my lady, unto this land of mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She messengers in plenty hath sent ye to the Rhine.**</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hagen of Tronje answered : " So heard I, more than once !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And had I for my masters not come unto the Huns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet would I you to honour have ridden to this land."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble host then kindly his guests took by the hand ;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And to the seat he brought them where he himself had sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then to the guests they offer'd (they busily did that),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In wide-mouth'd golden goblets, wine, mead and mulberry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bade to the newcomers a welcome heartily.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the royal Etzel : "I will to you confess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Naught in this world could give me a greater happiness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than ye have given me, heroes, in coming thus to me ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby the queen is also from mickle grief set free.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" And ofttimes have I marvell'd what was the fault in me —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So many guests right noble have I been wont to see —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ye unto my country to come did never deign ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now that I have seen you to joy is turn'd my pain.'*</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Said Riideger in answer (a knight of noble mood) :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Well may you see them gladly ; their faith indeed is good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all my lady's kinsfolk the same can well uphold ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They bring unto your palace full many a warrior bold."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The even of Midsummer, at mighty Etzel's court</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These princes made their entry ; and seldom hath report</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Told of such royal welcome as on these chiefs he spent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now was it time for eating ; and all to table went.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Amidst his guests more nobly a host ne*er took his seat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For them there was abundance whereof to drink and eat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And everything they wanted it was all ready made ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For truly of these heroes great marvels had been said.</span>
