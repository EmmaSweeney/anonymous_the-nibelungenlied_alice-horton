			<h2>ADVENTURE III.— HOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS.</h2>

44. 
The Prince was little troubled by pangs of heartache yet ! 
The people's talk, however, erelong his ears beset : 
How there was in Burgundia a maiden, passing fair ; — 
For her sake joy and sorrow thereafter he did bear. 



III.] HOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS. 9 

45- 
The beauty of this maiden was famed far and wide ; 
Her lofty mind, 'twas vaunted, excelled her beauty's pride, ""^ 
And brought her many a wooer, ri ding to Gunther's land, 
Who fain would see the damsel, and bid for that fair hand. 

46. 
And yet, however many contended for her love, 
Kriemhilda felt in secret that none her heart could move ; 
There was no man among them whose love she could reward ; 
That knight was still a stranger, who was to be her lord. 

47- 
But when the son of Sieglind to lofty love inclined, 
Compared with his, all wooing was as an idle wind ! 
Right well, in sooth, deserved he to win so fair a bride : 
Erelong the noble Kriemhild' stood at bold Siegfried's side. 

48. 
His followers and kinsmen, seeing that he would wed, 
Did counsel that the maiden he to the altar led 
Should be by birth his equal, — for his, and for their sake : 
" Then," cried the gallant Siegfried, " Kriemhilda will I take ! 

49. 
** That beauteous young maiden of the Burgundian land, 
For her surpassing beauty. Right well I understand 
No Kaiser were so mighty but, should he need a wife. 
That princess were fit consort to share his royal life." 

50. 
A rumour of the matter soon reached King Siegmund's ears 
('Twas buzzed among the people) ; his mind was full of fears 
For this his son's intention ; — that he was fain to wed 
The fair and lovely maiden, and would not be gainsaid. 



10 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

51- 
Sieglinda also heard it, the noble monarch's wife, 
And much heart-searching had she about her dear son's life : 
For well she knew King Gunther, and his bold warrior-train. 
They sought to turn the hero back from his wooing vain. 

52- 

Then outspake gallant Siegfried : " Beloved father mine, 
The love of noble women I will for aye resign 
Unless I woo where Love is, and give my heart its way. 
Such is my purpose truly, — whatever men may say. 

53- 
" If thou canst not forego her," the king said, " verily 
My will shall be as thy will, and well it pleaseth me ; 
And I will help thee end it, and do the best I can : 
Yet hath the royal Gunther full many a haughty man ! 

54- 
" If it were only Hagen, and no one else beside, 
He hides 'neath courtly seeming such overweening pride, 
That he'll do us a mischief, — of that I'm sore afraid, 
If once we go a-wooing this fair and stately maid." 

55- 
" Shall that be hindrance to us ? " asked Siegfried, fearlessly. 
** If what I ask in kindness he venture to deny. 
My strong right hand shall win it ! I'll wrest from him," quoth he, 
" Both land and lieges, surely, for all his subtlety." 

56. 
Then spake the royal Siegmund, " I do mislike thy speech ! 
Should tidings thereof ever to the Rhine-border reach, 
Thou durst not ever after into that country ride. 
Long have I known King Gunther, and King Gemot beside. 



III.] HOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS. H 

57. 
" By force can never any expect to win the maid/' 
Declared the good King Siegmund ; "that hath been always said ! 
But if thou with thy warriors wilt to her country ride, 
An' we have any friends left, Til call them to thy side." 

58. 

" Far be it from my purpose," cried Siegfried, eagerly, 
"That when I ride to Rhine-land warriors should follow me, 
Like an invading army ! I should abhor this thing — 
By force the glorious maiden into my arms to bring ! 

59. 
" I will not owe her winning to any other hand ; 
I and eleven others will ride to Gunther's land. 
Your help, good father Siegmund, I, for this purpose, pray." 
Then gave they to his warriors both coloured stuffs and gray. 

60. 
His mother heard the tidings, the lady Siegelind, 
She fell to grieving over her dear son in her mind ; 
Fearing lest she might lose him through some of Gunther's men. 
The noble queen refrained not from bitter weeping then. 

61. 
This seeing, young lord Siegfried to her his way did make, 
And unto his dear mother thus tenderly he spake : 
" I prithee weep not, lady, because of mine intent ; 
I have no fear of foemen, nor of disparagement. 

62. 

"Aid thou me in my journey to the Burgundian land. 
That I and my companions may bravely furnished stand 
In raiment that shall honour proud heroes, such as we, — 
Then will I for this favour, aye thank thee fervently." 



12 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

63. 
" Since thou wilt not forego it," did Siegelind declare, 
" ril help thee on thy journey, my only son and heir ! 
I will provide apparel, the best e'er warrior wore, — 
For thee and thy companions : and ye must take good store." 

64. 

Then bowed to the queen-mother Prince Siegfried, theyoung man. 
He said : " On this my journey I'll take, if so I can, 
None save eleven warriors ; for these be raiment made. 
I long to see how fares it with Kriemhilda," he said. 

65. 
So Sieglind's beauteous ladies sat stitching, night and day, — 
There were no idle fingers, and little rest or play, 
Until Prince Siegfried's raiment was ready to his hand. 
He'd not forego his journey to the Burgundian land. 

66. 

His father bade him polish his knightly harness grand. 
Wherewith he meant to ride out of royal Siegmund's land. 
And eke the glitt'ring hauberks they likewise did prepare. 
Together with stout helmets, and bucklers broad and fair. 

67. 
The hour of their departure for Burgundy was nigh. 
And men as well as women watched them forebodingly, 
Lest they again should never come to their fatherland. 
To pack their gear and armour the heroes gave command. 

68. 
Their chargers were resplendent, their trappings of red gold ; 
No knight could well be prouder nor had more right to hold 
A high head, than Sir Siegfried and his eleven men. 
He craved the king's permission to gallop Rhinewards then. 



in.] HOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS. 1 3 

69. 

With grief Siegmund and Sieglind accorded his request ; 
Whom Siegfried sought to comfort, as tenderly he pressed. 
He said : " Ye must not weep now through any care for me; 
And fear not lest my life be in any jeopardy." 

70- 

Sad-hearted were the warriors, and many a maiden wept : 
Doubtless their hearts foreboded mischance for those who leapt 
That day into the saddle, — they dreamt these friends lay dead, — 
They had good cause for mourning, in sooth there was much need 1 

71. 
Upon the seventh morning, at Worms, on the Rhine shore, 
Arrived the gallant horsemen ; the raiment that they wore 
With ruddy gold was flashing, and all their trappings shone : 
The chargers of bold Siegfried went pacing smoothly on. 

72. 

Their bucklers were new-wrought ones, andlight and broadbeside, 
And bright their helmets glittered, as unto court did ride 
Siegfried, the gallant chieftain, in royal Gunther's land. 
Such firie-apparelled heroes were ne'er seen on that strand. 

73- 
Theirlong-swords' points hung downwards unto the spurs they wore; 
And sharp, too, were the javelins which these bold heroes bore. 
The one that Siegfried carried was two spans in the blade, 
Its twofold edge was deadly, and ghastly wounds it made. 

74. 
All gilded were the bridles they lightly held in hand ; 
And silken were their horse-girths ; so came they to that land. 
The folk began on all sides on them to gape and stare. 
Then many of Gunther's people ran forth to meet them there. 



14 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

75- 
Those high and mighty warriors, and knight as well as squire, 
Went out to bid them welcome, as honour did require, 
Receiving them with kindness into their master's land, 
Taking their horses, straightway, and bucklers from their hand. 

76. 
They would have ta'en the chargers, and led them to the stall. 
Had not the gallant Siegfried said out, before them all : 
"Let mine and my men's horses stay here, as now they be, — 
It is my will and purpose to ride hence presently ! 

77- 
" I pray you therefore tell me — whoever knows this thing 
Let him not hide it from me — where I can find your king, 
Gunther, the mighty monarch of the Burgundian land ? " 
Then one among them told him, who knew where he did stand. 

78. 
" If you would find King Gunther, 'tis easy done, I trow, 
In yonder hall I saw him, and thither you must go ; 
He stands among his heroes ; and, if you'll thither wend. 
Full many a glorious warrior you'll find with him, good friend ! " 

79- 

Unto the king the tidings by this time had been told : 

How warriors were arrived all gallant to behold, 

Who wore white, ghtt'ring mail-shirts, and raiment rich and grand. 

And no one knew aught of them, in that Burgundian land. 

80. 
Then was the king astonished, and much he did inquire, 
Whence came these splendid warriors, in dazzling bright attire, 
And with such well- wrought bucklers, so new and eke so broad ; — 
It vexed the soul of Gunther that none could give him word. 



III.] HOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS. 1 5 

8i. 
Then Ortwein, lord of Metz, spake, and answered thus the king 
(Rich and high-couraged was he, and feared not anything) : 
" Since we know naught about them, bid someone straightway go 
And fetch my uncle Hagen, he'll see them, and may know. 

82. 

" He knoweth all the kingdoms, and ev'ry stranger-land. 
If aught he wot anent them, he'll make us understand.'* 
So the king sent to fetch him, him and his liegemen all ;— 
They watched his stately coming, with warriors, to the hall. 

83. 
What the king wanted of him ? first, Hagen sought to know. 
" There are within my palace strange warriors, I trow, 
Whom not a soul here knoweth ; if thou didst them e'er see, 
Declare it now, Sir Hagen, and tell the truth to me ! " 

84. 

**That will I," answered Hagen, and to the window went j 
One saw his keen glance wander, till on the guests it bent. 
Well pleased him their equipment, and raiment equally : 
But they were strangers to him, ne'er seen in Burgundy. 

85. 
He spake : " From whencesoever have come these cavaliers, 
They must themselves be princes, or princes' messengers. 
Their raiment is so splendid, their horses are so good ; — 
'Tis plain, where'er they come from, they are of noble blood. 

86. 

»* And," furthermore said Hagen, " though hitherto, I ween 

The famous hero Siegfried, mine eyes have never seen, 

I cannot help believing, how strange soe'er it be. 

That yon proud knight, there standing, can be none else but he !

87. 
" He bringeth us new tidings, here into this our land. 
The hardy Niblungs slew he with his own hero-hand, 
Both Nibelung and Schilbung, the sons of a rich king. 
He hath wrought mighty wonders, by sheer strength vanquishing. 

88. 
" For riding once, all lonely, and with no help at hand, 
He came unto a mountain, (as I did understand,) 
Where lay the Niblungs' treasure, well watched by doughty men, 
Who all were strangers to him, until he met them then. 

89. 
"The treasure of the Niblungs had just been taken then 
Out of a hollow mountain, — (Now hearken, my good men !) 
While as the Niblung warriors to share it did prepare, 
Young Siegfried came, and saw them : and had good cause to stare. 

90. 
" He came so nigh unto them that he could see them all, 
And they did also see him ; — then one of them did call : 
* Here comes the mighty Siegfried, the Netherlander strong !* 
He met with strange adventures the Nibelungs among. 

91. 

" The knight was well received by Schilbung and Nibelung ; 
And with one voice in counsel those noble lords and young 
Cried : * Share for us the treasure, thou honourable man 1 ' 
And eagerly besought him : so he to share began. 

92. 
** He saw so many jewels as I have heard men say, 
That fivescore waggons scarcely would carry them away ; 
Yet more there was of red gold, from out the Nib'lungs' land : 
And all must be divided by gallant Siegfried's hand. 



III.] HOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS. I7 

93- 

*' And unto him for wages they gave the Niblungs' sword : 
But little they foreboded what would be their reward 
For rendering this service to Siegfried, the good knight ; — 
Ere he could end the sharing they had begun to fight. 

94. 

"They had their friends anear them, twelve gallant armed men, 
Who all were mighty giants, — but what availed them then ? 
For Siegfried fell upon them and slew them in his ire, 
Full seven hundred Niblungs, vanquished in battle dire, 

95- 
" With their good sword resistless, that was yclept * Balmung.' 
And through the mighty terror that seized those warriors young, 
Dread of the sword, and hero who bravely did it wield ; — 
Their land and eke their castles unto him did they yield. 

96. 
" The wealthy kings he also smote, till they both fell dead. 
But he himself, through Albrich, was grievously bested, 
Who would avenge his masters upon the spot, — till he 
Found the great strength of Siegfried beyond his mastery. 

97. 

" The sturdy dwarf was powerless against him in the fray. 
Like lions wild to the mountain they twain then broke away. 
Till the Tarnhelm ^ from Albrich he wrested ; and thus lord 
Became the dreaded Siegfried of all the Niblung hoard. 

98. 
"They who had dared the battle there, one and all, lay slain. 
Then bade he that the treasure be carried back again 
Unto the cave, whence erstwhile the Niblungs did it take. 
And then did he stout Albrich his treasure-keeper make.

99. 
" By a great oath he made him unto him fealty swear, 
To serve him in all service, no matter when or where." 
So spake Hagen of Tronje, ** That did he presently : 
" There never was a warrior who had such might as he ! 

100. 

" And yet another story of Siegfried I have heard : 
How he did slay a dragon, with his own hand and sword, 
And in its blood he bathed him till horny grew his skin, 
And thus no sword can cut him, as hath been often seen. 

lOI. 

" Then let us this young hero receive as best we may. 

Lest we deserve his hatred and have to rue the day. 

He is of such bold spirit 'twere best to be his friend : 

He hath, by his strong right hand, wrought wonders without end." 

102. 
Then the great king said, " Truly, methinks that thou art right. 
See but how chivalrously he stands prepared to fight, 
He and his warriors with him, a dauntless man is he ! 
We will go down to meet him, and greet him courteously." 

103. 
" Thou mayest," answered Hagen, " with honour do this thing, 
His ancestry is noble, his sire a wealthy king. 
One sees it in his bearing, — and, by the dear Lord Christ, 
It is no trifle brings him, I warrant, on this quest !" 

104. 
Then spake the country's ruler : " Right welcome let him be,-— 
That he is brave and noble hath aye been told to me ; 
We'll make his sojourn merry in our Burgundian land." 
So saying, down went Gunther to where Siegfried did stand.

105. 
The host and all his warriors received the guest so well 
That nothing to good breeding was lacking, sooth to tell. 
The goodly man, on his side, bowed low before them there, 
And thanked them for their greeting, so friendly and so fair. 

106. 
" I marvel at these riddles," spake Gunther, suddenly, 
*' Whence have you, noble Siegfried, come unto this country ? 
And for what purpose come you to Worms upon the Rhine ?" 
The guest unto the king said : " To answer shall be mine. 

107. 
" To me were told the tidings, erst in my fatherland, 
That here with you were dwelling (which I would know firsthand,) 
The boldest of all warriors — oft said they so to me, — 
That ever monarch governed : lo, I am come to see ! 

108. 
" Thy fame hath also reached me ; I hear the knights declare 
That never king was bolder nor braver, anywhere. 
Such is the common folk-talk o'er all the land, in sooth, 
And I shall have no quiet until I know the truth. 

109. 
** I also am a warrior, and shall too wear a crown; 
And I shall ne'er content me until I win renown. 
Until the folk say of me, that I have proved my right 
To reign o'er land and people : my honour do I plight 

no. 
" And head thereto. And wert thou as bold as some men say, 
I will now wrestle from thee whatever is thine to-day ; 
I care not who gainsay it, or who may like, or hate : 
Thy broad lands and thy castles shall mine be, soon or late ! " 



20 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

III. 

The king did greatly marvel, and eke his liegemen all, 
At the strange declaration that from his lips did fall : 
To take his kingdom from him ! so that was his intent ! 
His thanes all heard it, likewise, and fierce was their dissent. 

112. 

" Whereby have I deserved this ? " Gunther the warrior cried, 
" That lands my father governed, with honour, till he died, 
Should be now wrested from us by force, by whomsoe'er ? 
That were to prove but poorly that we too knighthood bear." 

113. 

" Nought else will I," quoth Siegfried, " by that I fall or stand : 
If thy strength cannot peace win for thine own fatherland, 
Then shall my strong hand rule it, and after me mine heir ; 
If thou dost win, thine be it, and we thy rule must bear. 

114. 
" Thy heritage, mine also, are now alike at stake ; 
Whichever of the other shall wholly conquest make 
To him shall all be subject, — the land and all its folk." 
But Hagen and King Gemot in hasty answer spoke ; 

"5- 

" Far be it from our purpose," spake Gemot presently, 
" To conquer new possessions, and to cause death thereby 
At hands of heroes ; truly, we have a rich estate : 
Which pays us due allegiance, nor seeks a better fate." 

116. 
Round and about were standing his friends, in sullen mood ; 
The lord of Metz, Sir Ortwein, among the others stood ; 
He spake : " This friendly parley doth vex me sore, as knight, — 
Stout Siegfried unprovoked hath here challenged you to fight. 



III.] HOW SIEGFRIED CAME TO WORMS. 21 

117. 
" If you and your two brethren were here, without defence, 
And if he brought against you the army of a prince, 
Methinks I could o'ermaster yea, e'en such doughty one ! 
And force this haughty warrior to change his braggart tone." 

118. 
This saying stirred fierce anger in him of Netherland. 
He spake : "Ne'er shalt thou measure against my like thine hand ! 
I am a mighty king's son, and thou but a king's knight : 
Twelve such as thou art could not withstand me in the fight !" 

119. 

Ortwein, the lord of Metz, then for swords called, lustily ; 
Of Hagen, lord of Tronje, the sister's son was he; 
That he had held his peace still seemed not to Gunther right. 
But Gemot put his word in, the bold and ready knight. 

120. 
He thus spake unto Ortwein : " Now let thine anger be ! 
Siegfried hath not yet done us aught evil that I see, 
Our difference in goodwill we yet may end, I deem. 
And thus may gain his friendship ; 'twill better us beseem." 

121. 

Then spake the doughty Hagen : " Well do we to be wrath. 
Both we, and all thy warriors, for hath he not come forth, 
Here to the Rhine, to flout us ? he might have let that be ! 
My own good lords had never done him such injury." 

122. 
To this made answer Siegfried, that mightiest of men, 
" If what I now have spoken offend you. Sir Hagen, 
You shall have eye-proof, shortly, how this my strong right hand 
Shall do great deeds of prowess in this Burgundian land." 



22 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

123. 
" That I, for one, will hinder !" Gemot in answer said, — 
And unto all his warriors insulting speech forbade, 
Because such speech did grieve him. Then into Siegfried's head 
Came thoughts of Lady Kriemhild, the lovely, peerless maid. 

124. 

" Is not all strife unseemly between us?" Gemot said ; 

" However many heroes fell by our prowess dead, 

Small honour would by us be, by you small vantage won." 

Then answered him Prince Siegfried, the royal Siegmund's son : 

125. 
" Wherefore delayeth Hagen ? and Ortwein, what doth he, 
That he and his companions haste not to strive with me ? 
(Whereof he hath a' many e'en here in Burgundy)." 
But it was Gernot's counsel that none should risk reply. 

126. 
" You shall be welcome to us," continued Ute's son ; 
" You and the knightly comrades who come with you, each one ; 
Right gladly will we serve you, I and these kinsmen mine." 
Then for the guests were ordered goblets of Gunther's wine. 

127. 

Loud spake the country's ruler : " All that we have is yours, 
What ye desire, in honour, we'll call no longer ours. 
But gladly share it with you, be it or wealth, or blood." 
This wrought in good Sir Siegfried a somewhat softer mood. 

128. 
The knights were soon relieved of all the gear they brought ; 
And lodgment was found for them, — the very best was sought 
For Siegfried's knightly followers ; well were they lodged that day. 
And now, in all Burgundia, right welcome guests were they.

129. 
All honour too was shown them, on that and many a day, 
A thousand times more honour than I can ever say ! 
This had his boldness gained him ; and this is true I state : 
That seldom any saw him who long could bear him hate. ^^ 

130. 
On pastimes now and pleasure the kings and court were set. 
But, whatsoe'er they started, he outstript all men yet : 
For none could equal Siegfried, nor come his strength anear, — 
Whether it were stone-putting, or shooting with the spear. 

131- 

And when by courtly custom they will'd their games to play 
In presence of the ladies, — these knights of humour gay, — 
Approving glances followed the prince of Netherland. 
Yet his heart brooded ever on loftier love, at hand. 

132. 
Though to whate'er was passing he lent a ready mind. 
One gracious maiden ever he in his heart did find ; — 
So, likewise, did the damsel, whom yet he had not seen, 
Incline to him in secret, and talk of him, I ween. 

133- 
When in the court the young folk their warlike games began, 
The knights and their attendants, Kriemhilda straightway ran 
And watched them from the window, king's daughter tho* she were, 
Nor while it lasted did she for other pastime care. 

134. 
And had he known she watched him, whom in his heart he bore, 
It had been ample pleasure, — he would have asked no more. 
And could his eyes have seen her, ye need not to be told 
No better bliss and greater for him this world could hold. 



24 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

135- 

When he, among the heroes, down in the court-yard stood, 
Between the games, at leisure, as other warriors would ; 
So winsomely he stood there. Queen Siegelinda's son, 
That the heart's love of many a noble dame he won. 

136. 
And many a time he pondered : " How shall I e'er attain 
To see the noble damsel, whose love I seek to gain. 
Her whom I love so dearly, and have for many a day ? 
To me she's still a stranger, with sorrow I must say." 

137. 

Whene'er the kings were minded to ride throughout their land, 
Their vassal knights had ever to follow, close at hand ; 
And Siegfried must be with them, which did the maid distress, 
And he too suffered often, for her dear sake, no less. 

138. 
So dwelt he with the three kings (and 'tis all true you hear,) 
In Gunther's court and country, the space of one whole year ; 
And all that time his Lady he never saw at all. 
Through whom much love unto him and sorrow did befall.
