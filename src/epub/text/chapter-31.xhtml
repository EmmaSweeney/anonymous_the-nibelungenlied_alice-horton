			<h2>Adventure XXXI.— HOW THEY WENT TO CHURCH.</h2>
			<p>
				<span>" So cold I feel my armour : " quoth Volker presently,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Methinks the night is wearing and soon will ended be ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I mark that by the breezes ; 'twill very soon be day."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then many a man awoke they who still in slumber lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The morning light broke over the guests within the hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hagen began on all sides the warriors to call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To know if to the Minster to matins they would fare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meanwhile, in Christian fashion, the bells were chiming clear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So diverse was the chanting, thereby 'twas plain to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Christians and heathens were not in unity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet the men of Gunther to church would go withal ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They from their beds together had risen one and all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The warriors then array'd them in clothes so finely wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That better raiment never by heroes had been brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To any king's dominions. Ill did it Hagen please.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said he : " Now should ye, heroes, don other suits than these.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Enough about the matter ye surely understand ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye should, instead of roses, bear weapons in the hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For caps beset with jewels take shining helms and good;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since we are well-advised of wicked Kriemhild's mood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" This day must we do battle, I will to you declare ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instead of silken doublets, ye should your hauberks wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the place of mantles take bucklers good and wide —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That if they seek a quarrel, the brunt ye may abide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" My well-beloved masters, your friends and kinsmen too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go now unto the Minster, — that should ye gladly do —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pray to God Almighty in your distress and need :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For know now, of a surety, that Death is nigh indeed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" See, too, that ye forget not aught ill that ye have done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with true zeal and duty stand ye before God's throne.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of this, right noble warriors, I warn ye well afore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save God in Heaven may grant it, ye'll hear no masses more."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They went unto the Minster, the princes with their men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in the hallow'd precincts bold Hagen spake again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bade them halt, lest any should leave the company :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' None knoweth what the Hunfolk to us may do," said he ;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' My friends, set down your bucklers upright before your feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answer ye to any who may unkindly greet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With deep and deadly sword-stroke. Hark ye, to Hagen's rede,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So will ye find it worthy to serve you in your need."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With that Hagen and Volker, the twain together, went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In front of the great Minster. 'Twas done with this intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they might make it certain that the king's wife would need</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To crowd them as she enter'd : their mien was grim indeed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then came the land's Upholder, and eke his lady fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And deck'd about the body with raiment rich and rare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One saw the doughty warriors along with them go by ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dust aloft was whirling from Kriemhild's chivalry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now when the mighty ruler in armour saw array'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kings and their companions, how quickly then he said :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' Why thus my friends behold I marching with helmets on ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'T would grieve me, on my honour, had aught to them been done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" I'll gladly make atonement, however they think good ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If any here have vext them in either heart or mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I give them full assurance that sorely vext am I ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whatsoe'er they bid me I'll do it readily.'*</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To this made answer Hagen : " By none have we been harm'd.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is my masters' custom to go thus fully arm'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To every courtly meeting, — until three days have run ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Etzel we will tell it if aught to us be done."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This answer made by Hagen Kriemhilda heard right well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How hatefully upon him her sidelong glances fell !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet would she not more frankly her country's customs own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though they to her a long time in Burgundy were known.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet though her hate towards him so cruel was and fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If anyone to Etzel the truth had dared to tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He doubtless had prevented what came to pass ere long :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But none of them would tell it, her mastery was so strong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then with the queen advancing there came a mighty band ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But this same pair of warriors deign'd not to take their stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two hand-breadths further backward, which made the Hunfolk wroth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, they must press and jostle with those bold heroes both.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The chamberlains of Etzel were ill-content at this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And would upon the warriors have somewhat wrought amiss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If they had dared to do it the king's High Grace before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was a mighty jostling, but so far nothing more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When service now was ended and they would thence be gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All suddenly on horseback appear'd full many a Hun ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a beauteous lady was with Kriemhilda seen ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full seven thousand warriors came riding with the queen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>riemhilda with her ladies within the window sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>\.long with royal Etzel : well pleased was he thereat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>rain would they see the jousting those doughty heroes show'd :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>\.y ! in the lists before them what warriors strange there rode !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>\nd thither had the marshal, the right brave Dankwart, too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I!ome with his squires attending : his lords' own retinue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>IVith him, too, he had taken from the Burgundian land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>rhe steeds for the bold Niblungs well saddled were at hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>iVhen they their steeds had mounted — the kings and every man —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forthwith the stalwart Volker to counsel them began,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>rhat all should tilt together after their country's mode ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>[n course of which, thereafter, the chiefs right nobly rode.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For what the hero counsell'd they did not underrate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>rhe crowding and the shouting were both exceeding great.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>^Vithin the wide inclosure was gather'd many a man ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>rhen Etzel and Kriemhilda to gaze thereon began.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Six hundred knights together upon the field appear'd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>rhe warriors of Dietrich, coming the guests toward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>rhey thought with the Burgundians some knightly sport to try,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A.nd would, had he allow'd it, have done it readily.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A.y me ! what goodly warriors forthwith towards them made !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when to the lord Dietrich the news thereof was said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Gunther's men forbade he that any sport should be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He fear'd for his retainers : and surely need had he.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they of Bern pass'd onward, and from the place had gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The men from Bechelaren, of Riideger's, came on.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the hall five hundred with shield on arm rode they :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well pleased had been the margrave could they have kept away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then wisely, as behoved him, he rode the host throughout.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said unto his warriors, they could no longer doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that the men of Gunther ill will towards them had :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If they would leave the combat he would in truth be glad.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When these now had pass'd onward — high-mettled heroes bold —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came horsemen from Thuringia, as hath to us been told ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then the knights of Denmark, a thousand gallant men ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One saw right many a lance-shaft fly in the onset then.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Haward came and Irnfried unto the tournament.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Rhinelanders a challenge to them had proudly sent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The warriors of Thuringia were offer'd many a joust ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In many a noble buckler were lances deeply thrust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There, too, the lordly Bloedlin came with his thousands three.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Etzel and Kriemhilda right closely watch'd was he ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all the knightly jousting was held within their sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The queen rejoiced to see it for Burgundy's despite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Gibecke and Scrutan unto the melde rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Hornboge and Ramung, all in the Hunnish mode.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They held the lists, withstanding the chiefs of Burgundy ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over the king's palace the shafts went whirling high.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whate'er was done by any was nothing else but sound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loud was the din that echo'd palace and hall around,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From clash of shields and bucklers, by Gunther's liegemen made 3</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence praises and great honour unto his folk were paid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The ardour of their pastime so mighty was and great,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That from the goodly horses whereon the heroes sate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The snow-white foam was soaking through the caparisons.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In every courtly fashion they sought to meet the Huns.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then up and spake the minstrel, Volker the fiddle-player :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*'I trow that to withstand us these warriors will not dare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I've ever heard it said that they hate us verily ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now is the time to show it ; ? better ne'er will be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' Straightway unto the stables," so Volker loudly cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" We'll have the horses taken ; till towards the eventide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We'll ride some further courses, if there be time enow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What if to us Burgundians the queen some praise allow ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then saw they some one coming ; with stately mien rode he.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such that no other Hunsman with him compared could be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Belike in some high lattice a sweetheart there he had ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No knightly bride was ever than he more fairly clad,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Volker said : " How can I pass over such a chance?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yon darling of the ladies must feel a thrust of lance, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There 's not a man could help it ! 'twill stand him in his life :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I care not though I anger thereby King Etzel's wife."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" For love of me, forbear ye ! " King Gunther quickly spake ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" These people will upbraid us if we the onset make ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let ye the Huns begin it, more seemly 'twere, I ween."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now all this time King Etzel was sitting by the queen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" I'll make the hubbub greater," quoth Hagen, in his turn ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"We needs must let the ladies and these same champions learn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How we can sit our horses : 'twill be good sport withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though little praise to any of Gunther's men befall."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rode the ready Volker into the fray again :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby had many a woman, ere long, right grievous pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble Hunsman's body transfix'd he with his spear ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which soon both wife and maiden bewail'd with many a tear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With hurtling speed did Hagen rush forward with his men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His sixty chosen warriors ; and quickly rode he then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the fiddler's footsteps, to where the joust was held.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both Etzel and Kriemhilda plainly the whole beheld.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The kings were all unwilling their minstrel brave to leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the foemen fighting, and succour none to give ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand heroes therefore towards him deftly rode, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In high-accomplish'd fashion they did whate'er they would.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When that the noble Hunsman in death was stricken low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One heard among his kinsmen complaints and cries of woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the folk were asking : *' Who can this deed have done ? "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Volker, the fearless minstrel, yon fiddler is the one ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For swords and bucklers called they, and held them soon in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kinsmen of this margrave of the Hungarian land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They would have set on Volker, and slain him where he stood ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The host ran from his window with all the haste he could.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rose a mighty tumult among the people all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kings and their attendants dismounted at the hall ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind the throng his charger sent each Burgundian ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King Etzel came : to sever the nobles he began.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From one of the Hun's kinsmen, who chanced by him to stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He seiz'd a deadly weapon, and wrench'd it from his hand ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then drave the people backwards, for very wroth was he :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*• How vain unto these warriors had been my courtesy</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" If ye had slain the minstrel before my very face ; "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So spake to them King Etzel : " that were a foul disgrace !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For well I marked him riding, what time he pierced the Hun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And through no fault on his part, but by a slip, 'twas done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" To leave my guests in freedom, I charge ye to take heed.**</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So gave he them safe-conduct ; then led they every steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the hostel stables ; and many squires they had</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right diligent in service, who did whate'er they bade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The host into the palace took with his friends his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No wrath in any of them would he allow to stay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tables were made ready, the water was brought in :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet bitter foes in plenty had they from o'er the Rhine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ere all the lords were seated a good long time was spent ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whilst tortured was Kriemhilda by cares within her pent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She said : " I seek thy counsel, O prince of Bern, thy grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And aid : in sooth my business is now in evil case."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Hildebrand made answer, a worthy warrior he :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Whoever slays the Niblungs shall have no help from me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, not for any treasure ! thereby he grief may get :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These knights of ready courage have ne'er been conquer'd yet."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, in his courtly fashion, thereto Sir Dietrich spake :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"O mighty queen, I pray thee, thy purpose to forsake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To me thy kinsmen never have done such injury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I the gallant warriors in combat would defy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" The wish doth ill beseem thee, most noble prince's wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou anent thy kinsfolk wouldst plot against their life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trusting unto thy favour they came unto this land :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Siegfried is not avenged by aid of Dietrich's hand."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When she could find no falseness the knight of Bern within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then on the spot she promised to give to Bloedelin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A far-extending march-land, which Nudung own'd of yore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Dankwart shortly slew him, he thought of it no more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quoth she : " Thou ought'st to aid me, my good Sir Bloedelin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in this very palace are now these foes of mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who slew my husband Siegfried, so well-beloved of me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To him who helps avenge him, I ever bound shall be."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To her then answer'd Bloedel : " Lady, be sure of this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To them, for fear of Etzel, I dare do naught amiss.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since he thy kinsmen happy is ever fain to see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And did I aught to hurt them, he ne'er would pardon me."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Nay, rather, my lord Bloedel, your friend I'll ever be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guerdon of gold and silver I will bestow on thee ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke a lovely damsel — Nudung's betrothed bride —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom thou mayst love and cherish right gladly at thy side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"The land, too, and the castles, all unto thee I give ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, noble knight, thou mayest in gladness ever live,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou but winn'st the earldom which Nudung held in fee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whate'er to-day I promise, in truth I'll give to thee."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When now the noble Bloedel the guerdon heard her tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seeing that the damsel in beauty pleased him well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By means of strife he purposed to earn this lovely wife :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But for that cause the warrior was doom'd to lose his life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Unto the queen then spake he : " Within the hall go back ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere any guess my purpose, an uproar I will make.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hagen will have to answer for what to you he wrought ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King Gunther's man, I warrant, shall bound to you be brought."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now arm yourselves," cried Bloedel, " my gallant liegemen all !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We will upon the foemen within the hostel fall ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I may not be acquitted of this by Etzel's wife.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this must every hero among us stake his life."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the queen found that Bloedel was on the fray intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She tarried there no longer, but back to table went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sat beside King Etzel and with his men as well :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She for the guests' undoing had taken counsel fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Since means there were not elsewise to cause the strife to start,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Kriemhilda's olden sorrow lay graven in her heart)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She bade them bring to table King Etzel's little son :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How could a vengeful woman more cruelly have done ?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then went that self-same minute of Etzel's liegemen four,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thither from his chamber the young king Ortlieb bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the prince's table, where Hagen also sate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(The boy was doom'd to perish through Hagen's deadly hate.)</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as mighty Etzel espied his little son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He turned to his wife's kinsmen and spake in kindly tone :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Now, my good friends, behold ye, my only son is he.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke your sister's offspring : which well for you may be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" If he his kindred likens, he'll be a gallant wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right powerful and noble, a well-grown man of might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should I live some while longer he'll own a dozen lands ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So look ye for good service at my young Ortlieb's hands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" I therefore fain would pray you, O well-loved friends of mine^</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When ye are homeward riding unto the river Rhine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ye upon the journey would take your sister's son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let your loving kindness unto the child be shown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" And rear him up in honour till he to manhood grow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If any in your borders hath wrought you any woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he is of full stature he will your vengeance aid."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King Etzel's wife Kriemhilda heard also what he said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>** If unto days of manhood the child should grow and thrive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These thanes, I trow," said Hagen, " their trust to him will give.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet the young king, meseemeth, is of a weakly sort :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Folk will not often see me attending Ortlieb's court."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The king look'd round at Hagen, — this speech had vext him sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though, with princely breeding, he spake thereof no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His heart was very heavy and troubled was his mind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor was the mood of Hagen a whit to joy inclined.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The princes all were sorry, together with the king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That of his child had Hagen e'er spoken such a thing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ill content they bore it : nor knew they aught at all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of what through this same warrior was shortly to befall.</span>
