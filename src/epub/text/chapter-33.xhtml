			<h2>Adventure XXXIII.— HOW THE BURGUNDIANS FOUGHT WITH THE HUNS.</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Within the door an entrance thus gallant Dankwart made ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The household folk of Etzel to stand aside he bade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole of his apparel bespatter'd was with gore ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A mighty naked weapon within his hand he bore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then loudly Dankwart shouted before the assembled throng :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"Bestir thee, brother Hagen, thou sittest all too long !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thee and God in Heaven appeal I in our need :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yeomen and knights together lie in the hostel dead."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And he cried back in answer : '• And who hath done it then? "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quoth Dankwart : " The Lord Bloedel, together with his men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But dearly hath he paid it, that would I have you know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I smote his head from off him ; mine own hand gave the blow."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" 'Tis but a little grievance," quoth Hagen of Tronje ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Whene'er one has occasion of any thane to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he by hands of warrior was of his life fordone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So much the less fair women for him have need to moan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now tell me, brother Dankwart, why all so red ye be ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Methinks that thou art wounded and sufifer'st grievously.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If in the land he liveth who this on thee hath done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except the foul fiend save him, his life 's as good as gone."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" You see me whole and hearty ; with blood my clothes are red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But from the wounds of others it thus hath happened ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they have been so many that I have slain to-day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That verily their number on oath I could not say."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He answer'd : " Brother Dankwart, see to the door do thou,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let not of the Hunsmen a single man come through.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'll reckon with these warriors, as need we have, in faith !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our men-at-arms are lying in undeserved death."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" If chamberlain I must be," the gallant man replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" To serve such mighty rulers, I am well satisfied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'll answer for the stairway, as honour 's dear to me."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto Kriemhilda's warriors naught could more direful be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" It is to me a marvel," Hagen thereafter spake :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"What meaneth all the fluster these Hunnish warriors make?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They think they well could spare him, who yonder door doth hold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hath these high concernments to the Burgundians told !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Long time about Kriemhilda have I been wont to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she her bitter sorrow was not content to bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now drink we to her darling ! for royal wine we'll call !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The princeling of the Hunfolk shall be the first of all ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the child Ortlieb slew he, Hagen, that warrior good.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that from sword-blade downward flow'd o'er his hands the blood ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The infant's head was sever'd and on the queen's lap fell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then rose amongst the warriors a slaughter horrible.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With double-handed sword-stroke he dealt a blow at large</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the man of learning, who had the child in charge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His head all in a moment before the table lay :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In good sooth for the teacher it was but sorry pay I</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He saw by Etzel's table a certain minstrel-man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Hagen in his fury to fall on him began ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His left hand on the fiddle he lopp'd off suddenly :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" There 's somewhat thou canst carry for news to Burgundy ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' Woe for my hand ! " cried Werbel the minstrel : " wilt thou say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What evil I have done thee, Lord Hagen of Tronje ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all good faith I journey 'd unto your master's land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The notes how can I finger since I have lost my hand ? "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But little heeded Hagen, though he ne'er fiddled more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He wreak'd within the palace a vengeance grim and sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the knights of Etzel, of whom a host he slew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death dealt he in the palace to people not a few.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The ever-ready Volker up from the table sprang :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his hand right loudly his fiddle-bow outrang.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right fearsome was the music that Gunther's minstrel play'd ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay ! 'mid the gallant Hunsmen what enemies he made !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upsprang, too, from the table, the noble rulers three :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They gladly would have stay'd it, ere mischief worse should be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all their wit avail'd not the rising storm to quell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Volker joining Hagen to such wild raving fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When saw the Lord of Rhineland the fight could not be stay'd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The prince himself fought also, and many a wide wound made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his foemen's bodies, their shining mail-coats through.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hand-strong hero was he : as now all grimly knew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The stalwart Gemot likewise was forward in the strife ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay ! he among the Hunsmen took many a hero's life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A keen-edged weapon wielding, — by Riideger 'twas given.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By him were Etzel's warriors right grievously bedriven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The young son of Dame Ute into the fight now dash'd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gloriously his broadsword right through the helmets crash'd, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To grief of Etzel's warriors of the Hungarian land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There wrought were many marvels by gallant Gis'lher's hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Howe'er the kings and liegemen were valiant in the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above them all right plainly did Giselher in might</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stand forth against the foemen ; he was a hero good.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such wounds he dealt, that many fell weltering in their blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The men of Etzel also stood stoutly to the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There one might see the strangers go hacking to and fro</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their bright glancing weapons, all through the royal hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And horrid shrieks from all sides upon the ear did fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They who were on the outside would to their friends within ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But found that at the doorways small vantage they could win.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out from the hall right gladly would they within it fare :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But none of them would Dankwart let up or down the stair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereby around the gateways a mighty press arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And din of helmets also beneath the broadsword blows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus the gallant Dankwart fell into sore distress :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that his brother heeded, as bound in faithfulness.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For thereupon to Volker Sir Hagen cried aloud :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Now look you yonder, comrade, how round my brother crowd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Hunnish warriors closely, and blows upon him rain :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Friend, go and help my brother, or we shall lose the thane."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" That will I do full surely," answer'd the minstrelman ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And straightway through the palace his fiddling he began.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hand with his stout broadsword full often music made ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To him the Rhenish warriors unbounded thanks repaid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And soon the gallant Volker to Dankwart came and said :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" To-day no little trouble hath fallen on your head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your brother hath enjoin'd me to lend a helping hand :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If you'll look to the outside, within the door I'll stand."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dankwart the ever-ready without the gateway stood ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well guarded he the stairway, let any come who would.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One heard the clang of weapons in the bold hero's hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The like, within, did Volker of the Burgundian land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Loudly the valiant minstrel shouted across the throng :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" The hall is closed, friend Hagen, with bolt and barrier strong.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The door of Etzel's chamber is safely barr'd as well :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two heroes' hands that hold it a thousand bolts excel."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Hagen, Lord of Tronj^, knew that the door was fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His shield back on his shoulders the goodly chieftain cast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First fell he to avenging the ills upon him wrought :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of longer life his foemen had then but little thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Prince of Bern no sooner had seen how matters went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how the mighty Hagen so many helmets rent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than sprang the Amelung ruler upon a bench : quoth he :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" The liquor Hagen giveth is vile as drink can be ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The host was full of sorrow — good cause had he to rue :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What friends of him beloved before his eyes they slew !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hardly from his foemen unscath'd himself came he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In grief he sat — ^^what profit was it a king to be ?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The mighty Queen Kriemhilda to Dietrich call'd and said ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" With all your manhood give me, O noble knight, your aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By all those princes' merits erewhile of Amelung land :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should Hagen once have reach'd me, my death were close at hand.'^</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" And how am I to help you," Lord Dietrich answering said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Great queen, when I have reason myself to be afraid ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These followers of Gunther with wrath so sorely burn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I with no one's safety can now myself concern."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Nay, say not so. Lord Dietrich, thou noble knight and good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This day make plain to all men thy kind and virtuous mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that thou hence wilt help me : or I am like to die."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her fears had brought Kriemhilda to sore anxiety.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' Can I do aught to help you, I verily will try ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since never have I witness'd, for many years gone by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To such deep wrath enkindled so many a warrior good.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay ! through the riven helmets I see the surging blood."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This thane of proven valour with power began to shout ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like unto horn of bison his voice rang loudly out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until its strength re-echoed the wide-wall'd stronghold round.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mightiness of Dietrich was great beyond all bound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Gunther heard the clamour proceeding from this man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above the noise of battle, to hearken he began.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said he : " The voice of Dietrich is to my hearing plain ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I trow that our retainers some friend of his have slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" I see him on the table, he beckons with his hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye friends of mine and kinsfolk from the Burgundian land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cease fighting for a season, and let one hear and see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What to the thane hath happen'd through them who follow me."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when the royal Gunther besought and gave command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They, in the stress of battle, halted with sword in hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So great the power he wielded, not one durst strike a blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whilst him of Bern he challenged, with readiness enow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Said he : " Most noble Dietrich, what hath to you been done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By any of my people ? I'm willing, be it known.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amends and satisfaction right readily to give.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were any man to wrong you, right deeply should I grieve.**</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then answer'd the Lord Dietrich : " Naught hath been done to me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But let me leave the palace with your safe-conduct free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And get with my retainers from this fell strife away :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For that I'll owe you service assuredly for aye."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then unto him spake Wolf hart : " Why ask ye grace so soon ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That door, I trow, the fiddler hath not so closely done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we can force it open enough to get away."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"Now hold thy peace," cried Dietrich, "the devil thou dost play."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the royal Gunther : " That will I let you do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of this place depart ye, many be ye or few,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But not a single foeman — here stay they everyone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They have anent these Hunsfolk so basely to me done."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Dietrich heard that saying, he took beneath his arm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble queen, sore stricken with sorrow and alarm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon his other arm he took Etzel with him then ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There also went with Dietrich six hundred goodly men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then up and spake the margrave, the noble Riideger :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" If any from the palace be yet allowed to fare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who still are fain to serve you, to us let it be known :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thus may peace enduring betwixt good friends be sown."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whereto made answer Gis'lher, of the Burgundian land :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" To you shall peace and pardon be granted at our hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since you and your retainers were e'er of faithful heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You all shall, unmolested, hence with your friends depart."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Riideger the margrave departed from the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Five hundred men went with him or more, belike, in all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who came from Bechelaren, liegemen and friends as well ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By whom unto King Gunther great mischief soon befell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile a Hunnish warrior, who saw how Etzel went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Dietrich's side, to profit thereby was all intent ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But with his sword the minstrel fetch'd at him such a slice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That at the feet of Etzel his head lay in a trice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When that the country's ruler had got outside the place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He stopp'd and look'd behind him towards where Volker was :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>** Woe 's me for this dread stranger ; a cruel destiny</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is that all my warriors must dead before him lie I</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" And woe upon this feasting," the noble sovran cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" For one, by name of Volker, is fighting there inside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like to a savage boar, and yet a minstrel he !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I thank my Lord and Saviour I'm from that devil free !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Right evil sound his measures, his strokes are bloody red ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, and his tunes have smitten full many a hero dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not what against us this minstrel doth attest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For never have I harbour'd so downright ill a guest ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They'd let from out the palace as many as they chose ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then from the folk within it a fearful din arose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The guests for what had happen'd a dire revenge would have.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay ! Volker the undaunted, what helmets then he clave !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gunther, the noble ruler, turn'd at that noise around :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"Hear'st thou yon music, Hagen, which Volker there doth sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the Hunfolk fiddling, who through the door would go ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He hath a blood-red straker upon his fiddle-bow ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>** It grieves me beyond measure," Hagen in answer spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" That I before that warrior a seat in hall should take.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have been his companion, as he was likewise mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we shall aye be faithful if hence we ever win.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now mark, great king, how Volker doth thee and thine uphold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right willingly he earneth thy silver and thy gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through steel of hardest temper his fiddle-bow will smite ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He breaks from off the helmets their shining crests and bright.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" I never saw a fiddler so nobly hold his own</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As this same warrior Volker throughout the day hath done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On helmet and on buckler his music ringeth clear :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A gallant horse deserves he and raiment rich to wear."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of those of Hunnish kindred who had been in that hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not one was left within it alive amongst them all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now silenced was the uproar ; for none there were to fight ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aside was laid the weapon of every gallant knight.</span>
