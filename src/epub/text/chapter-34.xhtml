			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Down sat the knights and nobles, by all their labours spent;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Before the hall together Volker and Hagen went.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>These warriors over- weary lean'd on their shields for rest;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The while betwixt the couple pass'd many a ready jest.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then Giselher, the warrior from Burgundy, outspake:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"Dear friends, ye must in no wise seek yet your rest to take:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The dead folk must ye carry straight from the house away.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>There'll be another onset, that can I surely say.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Beneath our feet 'tis needful they should no longer lie.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And ere by storm the Hunsmen undo us utterly,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Some wounds we yet will give them, e'en as I love to do;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For firmly am I minded," said Giselher, " thereto."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Well 's me for such a master," said Hagen, thereunto;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"From none such rede were likely, save from a warrior true,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>As we from my young master this very day have had:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I trow all ye Burgundians may therefore be right glad."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then follow'd they his counsel, and carried through the door</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Dead warriors seven thousand and cast them therebefore.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>At foot of the hall stairway they fell upon the ground;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then rose a doleful wailing from all their kinsmen round.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Some few there were among them whose wounds were not so bad</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But that with gentler usage they yet might life have had,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Who from that height down falling in death must needs He low;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For this their friends were wailing and grievous was their woe.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then spake the fiddler Volker, a goodly hero he:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"Now witness I the truth of what hath been told to me:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Base cowards are these Hunsmen, they wail like womankind!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>These sorely wounded bodies they ought to tend and bind."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then deem'd a certain margrave he spake with purpose good.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He saw one of his kinsmen who lay amid the blood,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And clasp'd his arms about him and sought to drag him thence;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then shot the ruthless minstrel and slew him with a lance.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>And when the others saw it, a panic seized the crowd;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They all against the minstrel began to curse aloud.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then pluck'd he up a javelin, that temper'd was and keen,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Which by some Hun or other aim'd at himself had been.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>This, right across the fortress, he cast with might and main</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Far o'er the crowd of people; and thereby Etzel's men</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He warn'd to take their station more distant from the hall.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The folk his mighty prowess now dreaded above all.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Yet still before the palace stood many a thousand men.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Sir Volker and Sir Hagen began to parley then,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And unto the King Etzel all in their minds to tell:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Whence grievous ills thereafter those heroes bold befell.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"To give the people courage," quoth Hagen, " 'tis but right</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That ever should the nobles be foremost in the fight:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Not otherwise my masters have here been seen to do:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They hew right through the helmets, blood flows at every blow/'</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>So valiant was Etzel, he straightway gripp'd his shield.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"Now prithee be thou wary," said to him Dame Kriemhild,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"Oifer unto thy warriors gold overflowingly.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If Hagen yonder reach thee, death will be nigh to thee."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>So bold a man the king was, he was not to be stay'd;â€”</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The like of such great princes can seldom now be said!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Needs must they by his shield-strap to draw him backward try.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Again the savage Hagen spake to him scoffingly:</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"It was a far-fetch'd kinship," the warrior Hagen cried,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"That Etzel and Sir Siegfried to one another tied.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He was Kriemhilda's lover ere she set eyes on thee,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Thou coward king! why shouldst thou take counsel against me? "</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>To him so speaking hearken' d the noble sovran's wife.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Thereon within Kriemhilda was evil humour rife,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That he should dare upbraid her in face of Etzel's men:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Against the guests began she therefore to plot again.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Who Hagen, Lord of Tronje, will do to death," she said,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"And hither at my bidding will bring to me his head.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For him the shield of Etzel I'll fill with ruddy gold,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And give him lands for guerdon, and goodly burghs to hold."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Now truly," quoth the minstrel, " I know not what they lack 1</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I never yet saw heroes so sluggishly hang back</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>When one hath heard them offer'd so noble a reward:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>From this time forth can Etzel ne'er hold them in regard.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Of those who vilely batten upon their prince's bread</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And now are fain to shun him in his most pressing need,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of such here mark I many who would be reckon'd brave,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And stand like very cravens: shame must they ever have! "</span>
