			<h2>Adventure XXXVII.— HOW THE MARGRAVE RUDEGER WAS SLAIN.</h2>
			<p>
				<span>The strangers, until morning, right gallantly had done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By then Gotlinda's husband unto the court had gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, looking round on all sides, he saw such horrors there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As moved to inward weeping true-hearted Riideger.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"Woe's me," then said the warrior, "that e'er I saw the day !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To think that none availeth this misery to stay !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though peace would I make gladly, the king will ne'er agree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For more and more he dwelleth upon his injury."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Good Riideger inquiring straightway to Dietrich sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If they might make between them the noble king relent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he of Bern made answer : " Who could avail thereto ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King Etzel wills that no one should come betwixt the two."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now by a Hunnish warrior Sir Riideger was seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With eyes bedimm'd with weeping, as they for long had been.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the queen then spake he : " Now look how standeth he, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The man who hath with Etzel the most authority,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>** And who hath at his service the people and the land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How many a castle is there in Riideger's command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of which, through the king's bounty, so many he may own !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet he throughout this struggle no worthy stroke hath done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Methinks he little recketh if things go well or ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As long as he hath all things according to his will.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Tis said that he is braver than other men mote be :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that, in all this trouble, hath been full hard to see."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The warrior true-hearted, with downcast mood and grim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave heed unto the speaker. The hero look'd on him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thought : " This shalt thou pay for ! Thou say'st I am afraid ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast at court thy story somewhat too loudly said."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His fists to clench began he, and at him straight he ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And smote to such good purpose upon that Hunnish man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lifeless on the instant him at his feet he laid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thus King Etzel's troubles were all the greater made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Away with thee, base scoundrel ! " thereon said Riideger ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Of trouble and of sorrow I have enough to bear !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I refrain from fighting, why tauntest me for that ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In sooth I have good reason to bear the strangers hate,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" And all that strength avail'd me I had against them wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were 't not that I the warriors myself have hither brought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Twas I, in sooth, who led them into my master's land :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot raise against them, therefore, my luckless hand."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then answer to the margrave the great King Etzel made :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>** O Riideger most noble, how hast thou lent us aid I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So many dead already we in the land must own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more of them were needed ] much evil hast thou done."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The noble knight made answer : "The fellow made me wroth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By casting up against me the wealth and honour both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That by thy hands so freely have been bestow'd on me :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The liar got his guerdon a whit unluckily."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now came the queen unto them, who eke had plainly seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What, through the hero's anger, the Hun's reward had been.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all bounds complain'd she ; tears from her eyes she shed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Riideger thus spake she : " How have we merited</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" That you the king's misfortune and mine make all the more ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At all times, noble Riideger, you promised heretofore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you would in our service risk honour and eke life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I've heard the knights award you the meed in many a strife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The goodwill that you pledged me to you I will recall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When me you urged on Etzel, O knight excelling all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wit, that you would serve me till one of us was dead ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ne'er had I, poor woman, thereof such desperate need.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In that thou speak'st not falsely ; I pledged thee, noble dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I for thee would venture my life and my fair fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lose my soul, however, that sware I not at all :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>[ brought these high-born princes unto this festival I *</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Riideger," she answer'd, " thy steadfast loyalty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke thine oath forget not, that thou mine injury</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wouldst cease not to avenge me, and all my trouble sore.**</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then said to her the margrave : " I ne'er have fail'd before."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then likewise mighty Etzel to supplicate began,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on their knees before him they two besought the man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then seem'd the noble margrave sorely discomfited.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ever faithful warrior right sorrowfully said :</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now God have pity on me, that I have lived for this !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforward all mine honour I must for aye dismiss, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My truth and noble breeding that erst from God I got !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woe on me, God in Heaven, that death hath saved me not I</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Whichever side I part from to take the other one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall have acted basely and grievous ill have done ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if from both I sever, on all sides blame I have :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May He vouchsafe to guide me Who life unto me gave.'</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet still they urged him straitly, the king and eke his wife.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence came it many a warrior ere long must lose his life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Riideger's achieving ; till eke that hero fell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now of his direful doing I must the story tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He knew how this must evil and fearful sorrow bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And liefer would he therefore denial to the king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke the queen, have given : full sorely fear'd he that</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If e'er a guest he slaughtered, the world would bear him hate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Unto the king then spake he— that man of spirit bold :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Lord king, take back whatever from thee I have and hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both land and burghs : with neither will I have aught to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But on my feet departing, will into exile go."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the royal Etzel : " Who then will succour me ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The land as well as castles all will I give to thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou upon my foemen avenge me, Riideger.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou'lt be a mighty sovran, of Etzel nigh the peer."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Riideger made answer : " How could I this essay ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At home within my dwelling I bade them come and stay ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of drink and meat I offer'd to them in kindly wise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave them gifts : how can I now death for them devise ?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" The folk belike are thinking that I am cowardly !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My services in nothing to them did I deny —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or to the noble princes, or any of their men —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That we are knit in friendship repenteth me amain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>' I gave away my daughter to Giselher the thane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>[n all the world she could not have look'd for better gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>[n honour or good breeding, in truth or worldly gear ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>[ ne'er saw prince so youthful in virtuous mind his peer."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>5ut yet again spake Kriemhild : *' Right noble Riideger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>^ow let our grievous trouble for both your pity stir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>7oT me and the king also ; and bear ye well in mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>?hat never host was fated such baleful guests to find."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"hen to the noble lady the margrave answer made :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To-day, with life, must ransom by Riideger be paid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>or what to me of kindness thou and my lord have shown :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>or that cause I must perish, — and it must now be done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This very day, well know I, my castles and my land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>lust, ownerless, fall to you, through what ye now command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>ly wife and child commend I unto your gracious care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>nd eke the hapless people that at Bechlaren are."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now Riideger, God bless thee ! " the king in answer said ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>le and the queen together exceeding glad were made :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right well unto thy people our care we both will give,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>hough if good luck be with me I trust thou yet mayst live."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>nd so upon the venture body and soul he cast ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>thereon the wife of Etzel began to weep at last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>aid he : " What I have promised I must to you fulfil ; —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>^oe for my friends, whose foeman I am against my will."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then from the king one saw him depart in mournful mood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to his warriors turning, who close beside him stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He spake : " To don your armour 'tis time, my liegemen all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On yonder brave Burgundians, alas ! I needs must fall."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They bade their folk then hasten to where their arms were found,-</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haply it were a helmet, or else a buckler round, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whatever it was they wanted, their servants brought the same</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere long the baleful tidings to the proud exiles came.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Riideger in armour with men five hundred went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Besides a dozen warriors who help unto him lent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These would the meed of valour win in the stormy fray ; —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They had but little warning that death so near them lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Riideger in helmet one saw march on before ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keen-edged were all the weapons the margrave's liegemen boi</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And broad the shining bucklers upon their arms as well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Twas all seen by the fiddler : sore ruth upon him fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Young Giselher beheld, too, the father of his bride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With fast-bound helmet marching. That this could aught betic</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save what was good and friendly, how could he then forbode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble prince was therefore exceeding glad of mood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now suchlike friends be welcome," said Giselher the thanej</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"Which we upon our journey have had the luck to gain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my betrothed lady we'll profit here right well :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'm glad, upon my honour, this plighting e'er befell."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I know not what doth cheer you," the minstrel answer made :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>' When saw you e'er for friendship so many knights array'd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>iVith fasten'd helmets marching, and bearing sword in hand ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By us will Riideger pay for his castles and his land."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>en as the fiddle-player of speaking made an end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>3ne saw the noble Riideger before the palace wend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>3is goodly shield he lower'd and set before his feet :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>3e could not offer service, his friends he might not greet</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then cried the noble margrave to those within the hall :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be on your guard, I warn you, ye valiant Niblungs all !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>le should have had my succour, now must ye ransom me ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>)nce were we friends ; now will I be from the troth-pledge free."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"hey shudder'd at these tidings, those sorely troubled men ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>or them but little comfort there was therefrom to gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>ince he would fight against them whom they had held so dear !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I rom foes they had already had mickle ills to bear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now grant it, God in Heaven," the warrior Gunther said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you will let your pity be moved to our aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"j k.nd that abounding honour which hope unto us gave ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>luch liefer would I trust you thus never to behave."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I can in nowise help it," the brave man said thereto;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In battle I must meet you, since so I swore to do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>low guard yourselves, bold heroes, as ye your lives hold dear ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>rom me the wife of Etzel would no refusal hear."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Too late dost thou forswear us/' the great king answer made ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' Thou, Riideger most noble, by God shalt be repaid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all the love and fealty that thou to us hast shown, — •</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou wilt in thy kindness still to the end go on.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" And we'll be aye beholden, for all that thou didst give,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myself and eke my kinsfolk, if thou'lt but let us live ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those precious gifts thou gavest, what time, in good faith, here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Etzel's land thou ledst us : think of it, Riideger ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" How gladly would I do it," said Riideger the thane ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" As willingly at this time as ever I was fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My gifts in full abundance upon you to bestow ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No blame should I thereover e'er need to undergo."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Then have thy way," said Gemot, " O noble Riideger !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For never yet to strangers a welcome kindlier</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By any host was bidden than thou to us didst give :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that thou hast the profit if we should longer live."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Would God, most noble Gemot," said Riideger again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" That ye were back in Rhineland, and I myself were slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With some degree of honour, — since I with you must fight !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From friends have heroes never suffer'd such foul despite."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now God reward thee, Riideger," spake Gemot in reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' For those rich gifts thou gavest : I grieve that thou shouldst d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If with thee there must perish a mind so virtuous too ; —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here carry I the weapon thou gavest me, hero true !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And never hath it fail'd me in all this struggle dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a knight hath fallen, beneath its edges, dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strong is it and well-temper'd, a good and handsome blade ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>ween a gift so worthy by knight will ne'er be made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And should we not persuade thee to come unto our side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If friends of mine thou slayest who still within abide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thine own sword I'll smite thee and take away thy life :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thee, Riideger, I pity, and eke thy noble wife."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now would to God, Sir Gemot, that thus it e'en might be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all your will and purpose might *be fulfill'd on me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby your kinsmen longer might yet enjoy their life !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay ! gladly would I trust you with daughter and with wife."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the young Burgundian, the child of Ute fair :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why do you thus. Sir Rudeger ? All these who with me are</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To you are well-disposed ; an evil course you take ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your daughter fair too early a widow you will make.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" If you and your retainers in strife contend with me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How grievously unfriendly will that appear to be !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that beyond all others my faith in you I laid, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In such wise that your daughter my wife I would have made."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Unto your pledge be faithful, O prince of noble race,"</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Rudeger, " if haply God send you from this place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suffer not that the maiden for me atonement make ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be pitiful towards her, for your own virtue's sake."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" That would I do right gladly," young Giselher replied :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' But these my high-born kinsmen who still are here inside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If they at your hands perish, the friendship firmly knit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With you and eke your daughter by me must be acquit."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Then God have mercy on us ! " the gallant warrior spake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereon they raised their bucklers, as though a way to make,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By force, unto the strangers within Kriemhilda's hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then loudly from the stairway was Hagen heard to call :</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' Now for a while yet tarry, most noble Riideger ; "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such were the words of Hagen : "we would again confer, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myself and eke my masters, — forced by necessity :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How will it profit Etzel if we poor exiles die ?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>**I am in grievous trouble," yet Hagen said, *' the shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Lady Gotelinda gave me as mine to wield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Huns for me have batter'd and hack'd it out of hand :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In friendliness I brought it unto King Etzel's land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" If so be God in heaven would grant me of His grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hold as good a buckler once more before my face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As that which thou dost handle, right noble Riideger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No longer in the combat need I a hauberk wear."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Right gladly would I serve thee as touching this my shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Durst I make thee the offer in spite of Dame Kriemhild.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But do thou take it, Hagen, and bear it on thine hand ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay ! what if thou shouldst bring it to thy Burgundian land ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When he to give the buckler so readily agreed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then were there eyes in plenty that with hot tears were red.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of gifts it was the latest that unto warrior e'er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Riideger was given, the lord of Bechelar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How fierce soe'er was Hagen, however hard in mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet stirr'd that gift his pity, with which the warrior good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So nigh to his last moments, had freely him endow'd ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with him fell to weeping full many a chieftain proud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now God in Heaven reward thee, most noble Riideger ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The like of thee will never be met with anywhere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who unto exiled warriors so royally dost give :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God grant that all thy virtue for evermore may live."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' Woe 's me for this betiding ! " said Hagen yet again :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"We've had to bear already so great a load of pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must we with friends be striving? Now God our refuge be !'*</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then made the margrave answer : " It grieves me bitterly."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Your gift I'll now requite you, most noble Riideger, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Howe'er these high-born warriors themselves towards you bear,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wit that here in battle you ne'er shall feel my hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though all by you should perish of the Burgundian land."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In courtly wise he bent him, the worthy Riideger ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On all sides they were weeping that such heart-sorrows were</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By no one to be mended : — a dread necessity !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The father of all virtues in Riideger would die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then from the house-door speaking the minstrel Volker said :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Since my companion Hagen a truce with you has made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To you I also promise safe-conduct from my hand ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For well have you deserved it since came we to the land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" You must, most noble margrave, be messenger of mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These ruddy golden armlets gave me the margravine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I should surely wear them here at the revelry :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You must yourself behold them and witness bear for me."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"Would God in Heaven allow it," then answer'd Riideger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" The margravine should give you still more of such to wear I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto my wife your message right gladly will I give —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereof be ye not doubtful — if I to see her live."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And even whilst he promised, his buckler Riideger</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raised : and in mood of madness no longer could forbear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rush'd upon the strangers, — a very warrior now ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fast the mighty margrave dealt round him many a blow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Aloof together standing Volker and Hagen stay'd.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>According to the promise the warriors twain had made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet more, as gallant, found he waiting beside the door;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence Riideger the battle began with trouble sore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With murderous intention he was allow'd therein</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Gunther and by Gemot, who heroes should have been.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Giselher aside stood, so great his sorrows were ; —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For life he hoped, and therefore avoided Riideger.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Anon the margrave's liegemen nish'd forth upon the foe ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like warriors true one saw them after their leader go ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They bore their keen-edged weapons ready in hand to wield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a helm they shatter'd and many a noble shield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Many the swift strokes also the weary warriors spent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On him of Bechelaren, that straight and surely went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right through the bright mail armour, nigh to the very life ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glorious deeds of daring achieved they in that strife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Riideger's noble comrades within had made their way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Volker along with Hagen rush'd swiftly to the fray :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They gave to no one quarter, save to that single man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blood through helmets, shatter'd by hands of either, ran.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How grimly in that chamber the clang of swords uprose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many of the shield-plates sprang off beneath their blows ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The jewels hack'd from off them fell on the bloody floor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In such grim humour fought they as might be never more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The lord of Bechelaren went up and down the hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As one who might in battle by strength accomplish all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Riideger's achievements that day it might be told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was indeed a warrior, right praiseworthy and bold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here also stood those warriors Gunther and Gemot too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who in the stress of battle full many a hero slew ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Giselher and Dankwart, — the twain reck'd not for aught,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so full many a warrior unto his last day brought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well Riideger bore witness that he was strong enow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brave, with proven armour ; what heroes laid he low !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Twas seen by a Burgundian : wrath strove within him deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Riideger the noble then death began to creep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stout Gemot 'twas, who loudly the hero challenged then.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He cried unto the margrave : " Wilt thou of all my men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not one unscathed leave me, most noble Riideger ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It moves me beyond measure ; the sight I cannot bear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now lo ! the gift you gave me to your own ruin tends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since you have taken from me so many of my friends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now turn towards me hither, thou noble, gallant man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'll make your gift avail me with all the skill I can."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or ever that the margrave had won his way to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mail coats that erst were shining must needs be spoilt and dim.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then either at the other, thirsting for honour, ran ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each to guard his body from deadly wounds began.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet smote their swords so keenly, against them all was vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then was Gemot stricken by Riideger the thane</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Athwart his flint-like helmet, till downward flow'd the blood ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in a trice repaid him that gallant knight and good.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Aloft the gift of Riideger in hand he swung ; and though</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His own wound, too, was deadly, he dealt on him a blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right through his stalwart buckler unto his helmet's slot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fair Gotlinda's husband fell dead upon the spot.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In sooth a gift so precious was worse requited ne'er ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The two fell slain together, Gemot and Riideger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like-fated in the combat, each by the other's stroke.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When this great loss to Hagen was known, his wrath outbroke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus spake the Tronian hero : " In evil plight are we !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these two have we suffer'd so great an injury</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As ne'er can be o'ertided by peoples or by lands ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now hold we Riideger's chieftains as bail in luckless hands."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Woe on me for my brother, who here in death doth lie !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How cometh, every moment, some tale of misery !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I must mourn for ever the noble Riideger :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The loss to me is double, and grievous 'tis to bear."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Giselher, beholding his lady's father dead : —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they who still were living a grievous reckoning paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death fell upon them sorely seeking to take his own ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of them from Bechelaren there lived ere long not one.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now Giselher and Gunther and with them Hagen too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dankwart and Volker also, — all warriors good and true, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came forward all together, to where the twain were laid :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then was there by the heroes great lamentation made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Death sorely us despoileth," spake the lad Giselher :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" But make an end of weeping, and get we to the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cool our mail-clad bodies, worn as we are with strife ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here God, I ween, will grant us but scanty spell of life."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some sitting, others leaning, one saw there many a thane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They once again were idle : and round about them, slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay Riideger's companions. The uproar all was laid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So long the silence lasted, that Etzel grew afraid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Woe on me for such service ! " then spake the royal wife :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" These folk are not so trusty that on our foeman's life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall vengeance due be taken by Riideger's command :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He means to take them safely back to Burgundian land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" What boots it us. King Etzel, that we with him and his</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have shared whatever he wanted ? The chief hath done amiss :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He who should wreak our vengeance, doth wish a peace to gain."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereunto answer'd Volker, the all-accomplish'd thane :</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' Not so, alas ! the story, most noble queen, I rede ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, dare I charge with falsehood a dame so nobly bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thee, devilishly lying of Riideger, I heard ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he and his companions from peace have sorely err'd.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" That which the king commanded he did so zealously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he and all his people dead in yon chamber lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now cast about, Kriemhilda, on errands whom to send !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Riideger the hero hath served thee to the end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"And wilt thou not believe me, see it thou shalt anon !"</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to her heartfelt sorrow so was it straightway done :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They bore the mangled hero before the king and queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thanes of Etzel never so sad a sight had seen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they beheld the margrave thus borne before them dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No penman could have written, nor elsewise could be said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How manifold the mourning of women and of men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who one and all bore witness unto their heart-felt pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sorrowing of Etzel so great was, that the noise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was even as a lion's, — the mighty king his voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Hfted in his anguish : eke mourn'd his wife no less :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good Riideger bewail'd they with utmost bitterness.</span>
