			<h2>Adventure XXXVII.— HOW THE MARGRAVE RUDEGER WAS SLAIN</h2>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The strangers, until morning, right gallantly had done.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By then Gotlinda's husband unto the court had gone.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And, looking round on all sides, he saw such horrors there</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>As moved to inward weeping true-hearted Riideger.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Woe's me," then said the warrior, "that e'er I saw the day!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To think that none availeth this misery to stay!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Though peace would I make gladly, the king will ne'er agree,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For more and more he dwelleth upon his injury."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Good Riideger inquiring straightway to Dietrich sent,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If they might make between them the noble king relent.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But he of Bern made answer: " Who could avail thereto?</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>King Etzel wills that no one should come betwixt the two."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Now by a Hunnish warrior Sir Riideger was seen</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With eyes bedimm'd with weeping, as they for long had been.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Unto the queen then spake he: " Now look how standeth he,—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The man who hath with Etzel the most authority,</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"And who hath at his service the people and the land.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>How many a castle is there in Riideger's command,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of which, through the king's bounty, so many he may own!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Yet he throughout this struggle no worthy stroke hath done.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Methinks he little recketh if things go well or ill,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>As long as he hath all things according to his will.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>'Tis said that he is braver than other men mote be:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But that, in all this trouble, hath been full hard to see."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The warrior true-hearted, with downcast mood and grim,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Gave heed unto the speaker. The hero look'd on him.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And thought: " This shalt thou pay for! Thou say'st I am afraid?</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Thou hast at court thy story somewhat too loudly said."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>His fists to clench began he, and at him straight he ran,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And smote to such good purpose upon that Hunnish man</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That lifeless on the instant him at his feet he laid.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But thus King Etzel's troubles were all the greater made.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Away with thee, base scoundrel! " thereon said Riideger;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"Of trouble and of sorrow I have enough to bear!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If I refrain from fighting, why tauntest me for that?</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>In sooth I have good reason to bear the strangers hate,</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"And all that strength avail'd me I had against them wrought,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Were 't not that I the warriors myself have hither brought.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>'Twas I, in sooth, who led them into my master's land:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I cannot raise against them, therefore, my luckless hand."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then answer to the margrave the great King Etzel made:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"O Riideger most noble, how hast thou lent us aid I</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>So many dead already we in the land must own.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>No more of them were needed ] much evil hast thou done."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The noble knight made answer: "The fellow made me wroth</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By casting up against me the wealth and honour both</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That by thy hands so freely have been bestow'd on me:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The liar got his guerdon a whit unluckily."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Now came the queen unto them, who eke had plainly seen</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>What, through the hero's anger, the Hun's reward had been.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Beyond all bounds complain'd she; tears from her eyes she shed.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To Riideger thus spake she: " How have we merited</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"That you the king's misfortune and mine make all the more?</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>At all times, noble Riideger, you promised heretofore</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That you would in our service risk honour and eke life.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I've heard the knights award you the meed in many a strife.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The goodwill that you pledged me to you I will recall</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>When me you urged on Etzel, O knight excelling all,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To wit, that you would serve me till one of us was dead;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And ne'er had I, poor woman, thereof such desperate need.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>In that thou speak'st not falsely; I pledged thee, noble dame,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That I for thee would venture my life and my fair fame.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To lose my soul, however, that sware I not at all:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>[ brought these high-born princes unto this festival I '</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>O Riideger," she answer'd, " thy steadfast loyalty</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And eke thine oath forget not, that thou mine injury</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Wouldst cease not to avenge me, and all my trouble sore."</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then said to her the margrave: " I ne'er have fail'd before."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then likewise mighty Etzel to supplicate began,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And on their knees before him they two besought the man.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then seem'd the noble margrave sorely discomfited.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The ever faithful warrior right sorrowfully said:</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Now God have pity on me, that I have lived for this!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Henceforward all mine honour I must for aye dismiss,—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>My truth and noble breeding that erst from God I got!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Woe on me, God in Heaven, that death hath saved me not I</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Whichever side I part from to take the other one,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I shall have acted basely and grievous ill have done;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But if from both I sever, on all sides blame I have:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>May He vouchsafe to guide me Who life unto me gave.'</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Yet still they urged him straitly, the king and eke his wife.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Thence came it many a warrior ere long must lose his life</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By Riideger's achieving; till eke that hero fell.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Now of his direful doing I must the story tell.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>He knew how this must evil and fearful sorrow bring,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And liefer would he therefore denial to the king,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And eke the queen, have given: full sorely fear'd he that</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If e'er a guest he slaughtered, the world would bear him hate.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Unto the king then spake he— that man of spirit bold:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"Lord king, take back whatever from thee I have and hold,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Both land and burghs: with neither will I have aught to do,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But on my feet departing, will into exile go."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then spake the royal Etzel: " Who then will succour me?</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The land as well as castles all will I give to thee.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If thou upon my foemen avenge me, Riideger.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Thou'lt be a mighty sovran, of Etzel nigh the peer."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>But Riideger made answer: " How could I this essay?</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>At home within my dwelling I bade them come and stay;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of drink and meat I offer'd to them in kindly wise.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And gave them gifts: how can I now death for them devise?</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"The folk belike are thinking that I am cowardly!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>My services in nothing to them did I deny—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Or to the noble princes, or any of their men—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That we are knit in friendship repenteth me amain.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>' I gave away my daughter to Giselher the thane,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>[n all the world she could not have look'd for better gain</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>[n honour or good breeding, in truth or worldly gear;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>[ ne'er saw prince so youthful in virtuous mind his peer."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>5ut yet again spake Kriemhild: " Right noble Riideger,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>ow let our grievous trouble for both your pity stir,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>7oT me and the king also; and bear ye well in mind</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>?hat never host was fated such baleful guests to find."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"hen to the noble lady the margrave answer made:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To-day, with life, must ransom by Riideger be paid</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>or what to me of kindness thou and my lord have shown:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>or that cause I must perish,—and it must now be done.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>This very day, well know I, my castles and my land</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>lust, ownerless, fall to you, through what ye now command,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>ly wife and child commend I unto your gracious care,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>nd eke the hapless people that at Bechlaren are."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Now Riideger, God bless thee! " the king in answer said;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>le and the queen together exceeding glad were made:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Right well unto thy people our care we both will give,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>hough if good luck be with me I trust thou yet mayst live."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>nd so upon the venture body and soul he cast;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>thereon the wife of Etzel began to weep at last,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>aid he: " What I have promised I must to you fulfil;—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>oe for my friends, whose foeman I am against my will."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then from the king one saw him depart in mournful mood.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And to his warriors turning, who close beside him stood,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He spake: " To don your armour 'tis time, my liegemen all.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>On yonder brave Burgundians, alas! I needs must fall."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>They bade their folk then hasten to where their arms were found,-</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Haply it were a helmet, or else a buckler round,—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Whatever it was they wanted, their servants brought the same</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Ere long the baleful tidings to the proud exiles came.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>So Riideger in armour with men five hundred went,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Besides a dozen warriors who help unto him lent.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>These would the meed of valour win in the stormy fray;—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They had but little warning that death so near them lay.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then Riideger in helmet one saw march on before;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Keen-edged were all the weapons the margrave's liegemen boi</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And broad the shining bucklers upon their arms as well.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>'Twas all seen by the fiddler: sore ruth upon him fell.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Young Giselher beheld, too, the father of his bride</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With fast-bound helmet marching. That this could aught betic</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Save what was good and friendly, how could he then forbode</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The noble prince was therefore exceeding glad of mood.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Now suchlike friends be welcome," said Giselher the thanej</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"Which we upon our journey have had the luck to gain.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of my betrothed lady we'll profit here right well:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I'm glad, upon my honour, this plighting e'er befell."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>I know not what doth cheer you," the minstrel answer made:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>' When saw you e'er for friendship so many knights array'd,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>iVith fasten'd helmets marching, and bearing sword in hand?</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By us will Riideger pay for his castles and his land."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>en as the fiddle-player of speaking made an end,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>3ne saw the noble Riideger before the palace wend.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>3is goodly shield he lower'd and set before his feet:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>3e could not offer service, his friends he might not greet</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then cried the noble margrave to those within the hall:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Be on your guard, I warn you, ye valiant Niblungs all!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>le should have had my succour, now must ye ransom me;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>)nce were we friends; now will I be from the troth-pledge free."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"hey shudder'd at these tidings, those sorely troubled men;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>or them but little comfort there was therefrom to gain,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>ince he would fight against them whom they had held so dear!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I rom foes they had already had mickle ills to bear.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Now grant it, God in Heaven," the warrior Gunther said</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That you will let your pity be moved to our aid,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"j k.nd that abounding honour which hope unto us gave;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>luch liefer would I trust you thus never to behave."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>I can in nowise help it," the brave man said thereto;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>In battle I must meet you, since so I swore to do.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>low guard yourselves, bold heroes, as ye your lives hold dear;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>rom me the wife of Etzel would no refusal hear."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Too late dost thou forswear us/' the great king answer made;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"Thou, Riideger most noble, by God shalt be repaid</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For all the love and fealty that thou to us hast shown,—•</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If thou wilt in thy kindness still to the end go on.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"And we'll be aye beholden, for all that thou didst give,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Myself and eke my kinsfolk, if thou'lt but let us live;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Those precious gifts thou gavest, what time, in good faith, here</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To Etzel's land thou ledst us: think of it, Riideger! "</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"How gladly would I do it," said Riideger the thane;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"As willingly at this time as ever I was fain</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>My gifts in full abundance upon you to bestow;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>No blame should I thereover e'er need to undergo."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Then have thy way," said Gernot, " O noble Riideger!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For never yet to strangers a welcome kindlier</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By any host was bidden than thou to us didst give:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of that thou hast the profit if we should longer live."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Would God, most noble Gernot," said Riideger again,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"That ye were back in Rhineland, and I myself were slain</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With some degree of honour,—since I with you must fight!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>From friends have heroes never suffer'd such foul despite."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Now God reward thee, Riideger," spake Gernot in reply,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"For those rich gifts thou gavest: I grieve that thou shouldst d</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If with thee there must perish a mind so virtuous too;—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Here carry I the weapon thou gavest me, hero true!</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>And never hath it fail'd me in all this struggle dread,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And many a knight hath fallen, beneath its edges, dead.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Strong is it and well-temper'd, a good and handsome blade;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>ween a gift so worthy by knight will ne'er be made.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>And should we not persuade thee to come unto our side,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If friends of mine thou slayest who still within abide,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With thine own sword I'll smite thee and take away thy life:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Thee, Riideger, I pity, and eke thy noble wife."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Now would to God, Sir Gernot, that thus it e'en might be,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That all your will and purpose might 'be fulfill'd on me.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Whereby your kinsmen longer might yet enjoy their life!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Ay! gladly would I trust you with daughter and with wife."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then spake the young Burgundian, the child of Ute fair:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Why do you thus. Sir Rudeger? All these who with me are</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To you are well-disposed; an evil course you take;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Your daughter fair too early a widow you will make.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"If you and your retainers in strife contend with me,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>How grievously unfriendly will that appear to be!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>In that beyond all others my faith in you I laid,—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>In such wise that your daughter my wife I would have made."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Unto your pledge be faithful, O prince of noble race,"</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Said Rudeger, " if haply God send you from this place;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Suffer not that the maiden for me atonement make;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Be pitiful towards her, for your own virtue's sake."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"That would I do right gladly," young Giselher replied:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"But these my high-born kinsmen who still are here inside,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>If they at your hands perish, the friendship firmly knit</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>With you and eke your daughter by me must be acquit."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Then God have mercy on us! " the gallant warrior spake.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Thereon they raised their bucklers, as though a way to make,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By force, unto the strangers within Kriemhilda's hall.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then loudly from the stairway was Hagen heard to call:</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Now for a while yet tarry, most noble Riideger; "</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Such were the words of Hagen: "we would again confer,—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Myself and eke my masters,—forced by necessity:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>How will it profit Etzel if we poor exiles die?</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"I am in grievous trouble," yet Hagen said, " the shield</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That Lady Gotelinda gave me as mine to wield,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The Huns for me have batter'd and hack'd it out of hand:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>In friendliness I brought it unto King Etzel's land.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"If so be God in heaven would grant me of His grace</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To hold as good a buckler once more before my face,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>As that which thou dost handle, right noble Riideger,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>No longer in the combat need I a hauberk wear."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Right gladly would I serve thee as touching this my shield,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Durst I make thee the offer in spite of Dame Kriemhild.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But do thou take it, Hagen, and bear it on thine hand;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Ay! what if thou shouldst bring it to thy Burgundian land! "</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>When he to give the buckler so readily agreed,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then were there eyes in plenty that with hot tears were red.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of gifts it was the latest that unto warrior e'er</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By Riideger was given, the lord of Bechelar.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>How fierce soe'er was Hagen, however hard in mood,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Yet stirr'd that gift his pity, with which the warrior good,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>So nigh to his last moments, had freely him endow'd;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And with him fell to weeping full many a chieftain proud.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Now God in Heaven reward thee, most noble Riideger;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The like of thee will never be met with anywhere,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Who unto exiled warriors so royally dost give:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>God grant that all thy virtue for evermore may live."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Woe 's me for this betiding! " said Hagen yet again:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"We've had to bear already so great a load of pain,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Must we with friends be striving? Now God our refuge be!"</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then made the margrave answer: " It grieves me bitterly."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Your gift I'll now requite you, most noble Riideger,—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Howe'er these high-born warriors themselves towards you bear,—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To wit that here in battle you ne'er shall feel my hand,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Though all by you should perish of the Burgundian land."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>In courtly wise he bent him, the worthy Riideger;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>On all sides they were weeping that such heart-sorrows were</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By no one to be mended:—a dread necessity!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The father of all virtues in Riideger would die.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Then from the house-door speaking the minstrel Volker said:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"Since my companion Hagen a truce with you has made,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To you I also promise safe-conduct from my hand;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For well have you deserved it since came we to the land.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"You must, most noble margrave, be messenger of mine.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>These ruddy golden armlets gave me the margravine,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That I should surely wear them here at the revelry:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>You must yourself behold them and witness bear for me."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Would God in Heaven allow it," then answer'd Riideger,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"The margravine should give you still more of such to wear I</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Unto my wife your message right gladly will I give—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Thereof be ye not doubtful—if I to see her live."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>And even whilst he promised, his buckler Riideger</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Raised: and in mood of madness no longer could forbear,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But rush'd upon the strangers,—a very warrior now;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And fast the mighty margrave dealt round him many a blow.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Aloof together standing Volker and Hagen stay'd.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>According to the promise the warriors twain had made.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Yet more, as gallant, found he waiting beside the door;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Whence Riideger the battle began with trouble sore.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>With murderous intention he was allow'd therein</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By Gunther and by Gernot, who heroes should have been.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>But Giselher aside stood, so great his sorrows were;—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For life he hoped, and therefore avoided Riideger.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Anon the margrave's liegemen nish'd forth upon the foe;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Like warriors true one saw them after their leader go;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They bore their keen-edged weapons ready in hand to wield,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And many a helm they shatter'd and many a noble shield.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Many the swift strokes also the weary warriors spent</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>On him of Bechelaren, that straight and surely went</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Right through the bright mail armour, nigh to the very life;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And glorious deeds of daring achieved they in that strife.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>When Riideger's noble comrades within had made their way,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Volker along with Hagen rush'd swiftly to the fray:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They gave to no one quarter, save to that single man.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The blood through helmets, shatter'd by hands of either, ran.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>How grimly in that chamber the clang of swords uprose,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And many of the shield-plates sprang off beneath their blows;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The jewels hack'd from off them fell on the bloody floor.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>In such grim humour fought they as might be never more.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>The lord of Bechelaren went up and down the hall.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>As one who might in battle by strength accomplish all.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>By Riideger's achievements that day it might be told</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He was indeed a warrior, right praiseworthy and bold.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Here also stood those warriors Gunther and Gernot too,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Who in the stress of battle full many a hero slew;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And Giselher and Dankwart,—the twain reck'd not for aught,—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And so full many a warrior unto his last day brought.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Well Riideger bore witness that he was strong enow,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And brave, with proven armour; what heroes laid he low!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>'Twas seen by a Burgundian: wrath strove within him deep.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>On Riideger the noble then death began to creep.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Stout Gernot 'twas, who loudly the hero challenged then.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He cried unto the margrave: " Wilt thou of all my men</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Not one unscathed leave me, most noble Riideger?</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>It moves me beyond measure; the sight I cannot bear.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Now lo! the gift you gave me to your own ruin tends,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Since you have taken from me so many of my friends.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Now turn towards me hither, thou noble, gallant man,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>I'll make your gift avail me with all the skill I can."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Or ever that the margrave had won his way to him,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Mail coats that erst were shining must needs be spoilt and dim.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then either at the other, thirsting for honour, ran;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And each to guard his body from deadly wounds began.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Yet smote their swords so keenly, against them all was vain.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And then was Gernot stricken by Riideger the thane</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Athwart his flint-like helmet, till downward flow'd the blood;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>All in a trice repaid him that gallant knight and good.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Aloft the gift of Riideger in hand he swung; and though</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>His own wound, too, was deadly, he dealt on him a blow</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Right through his stalwart buckler unto his helmet's slot.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The fair Gotlinda's husband fell dead upon the spot.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>In sooth a gift so precious was worse requited ne'er;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The two fell slain together, Gernot and Riideger,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Like-fated in the combat, each by the other's stroke.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>When this great loss to Hagen was known, his wrath outbroke.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Thus spake the Tronian hero: " In evil plight are we!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>In these two have we suffer'd so great an injury</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>As ne'er can be o'ertided by peoples or by lands;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Now hold we Riideger's chieftains as bail in luckless hands."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Woe on me for my brother, who here in death doth lie!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>How cometh, every moment, some tale of misery!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And I must mourn for ever the noble Riideger:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The loss to me is double, and grievous 'tis to bear."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>So Giselher, beholding his lady's father dead :—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And they who still were living a grievous reckoning paid,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Death fell upon them sorely seeking to take his own;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Of them from Bechelaren there lived ere long not one.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Now Giselher and Gunther and with them Hagen too,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Dankwart and Volker also,—all warriors good and true,—</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Came forward all together, to where the twain were laid:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Then was there by the heroes great lamentation made.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Death sorely us despoileth," spake the lad Giselher:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"But make an end of weeping, and get we to the air</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>To cool our mail-clad bodies, worn as we are with strife;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Here God, I ween, will grant us but scanty spell of life."</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>Some sitting, others leaning, one saw there many a thane.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They once again were idle: and round about them, slain.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Lay Riideger's companions. The uproar all was laid.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>So long the silence lasted, that Etzel grew afraid.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Woe on me for such service! " then spake the royal wife:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>"These folk are not so trusty that on our foeman's life</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Shall vengeance due be taken by Riideger's command:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He means to take them safely back to Burgundian land.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"What boots it us. King Etzel, that we with him and his</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Have shared whatever he wanted? The chief hath done amiss:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>He who should wreak our vengeance, doth wish a peace to gain."</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Thereunto answer'd Volker, the all-accomplish'd thane:</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"Not so, alas! the story, most noble queen, I rede;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And, dare I charge with falsehood a dame so nobly bred,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Thee, devilishly lying of Riideger, I heard;</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For he and his companions from peace have sorely err'd.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"That which the king commanded he did so zealously,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>That he and all his people dead in yon chamber lie.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Now cast about, Kriemhilda, on errands whom to send!</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>For Riideger the hero hath served thee to the end.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>"And wilt thou not believe me, see it thou shalt anon!"</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>And to her heartfelt sorrow so was it straightway done:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>They bore the mangled hero before the king and queen.</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>The thanes of Etzel never so sad a sight had seen.</span>
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>
					<span>When they beheld the margrave thus borne before them dead,</span>
				</span>

					<span>No penman could have written, nor elsewise could be said,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>How manifold the mourning of women and of men,</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Who one and all bore witness unto their heart-felt pain.</span>

					<span>The sorrowing of Etzel so great was, that the noise</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Was even as a lion's,—the mighty king his voice</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>So Hfted in his anguish: eke mourn'd his wife no less:</span>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span>
					<span>Good Riideger bewail'd they with utmost bitterness.</span>
