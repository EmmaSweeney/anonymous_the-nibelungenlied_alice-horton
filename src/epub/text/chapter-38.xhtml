			<h2>Adventure XXXVIII.— HOW LORD DIETRICH'S WARRIORS ALL WERE SLAIN.</h2>
			<p>
				<span>So great a sound of mourning on every side was heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From palace walls and turrets the echoes all were stirr'd.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By one of Dietrich's liegemen of Bern 'twas heard as well ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How swiftly then he started the direful news to tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Unto the prince then spake he : " Hearken, my Lord Dietrich,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As long as I've been living, ne'er have I heard the like</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of such unearthly wailing as I have heard but now :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some harm unto King Etzel himself hath come, I trow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" How else would all the people be in distress so dread ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The king, or may be Kriemhild, must one of them be dead, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slain by those daring strangers, who bore them enmity :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many goodly warriors are waiHng bitterly."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake of Bern the hero : " My trusty lieges dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now be ye not too hasty ! what hath befallen here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was wrought by homeless warriors, by dire distresses driven ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let them use the freedom that I to them have given."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the gallant Wolfhart : " I will myself be gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ask about the matter, what 'tis that they have done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then I will report it to you, my master dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When yonder I discover what mean the cries we hear,"</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereon Lord Dietrich answer'd : " When one has wrath to face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full oft, at ill-timed questions, 'tis found to be the case</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That warriors too swiftly are apt offence to take :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In truth I will not, Wolfhart, that you the quest should make."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereon he summon'd Helfrich right speedily to go ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the men of Etzel he bade him get to know, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or even from the strangers, — what doings there had been ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ne'er such great lamenting of people was there seen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The envoy made inquiry : " What hath there here been done ? "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then answer'd one among them : " Now is for ever gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All that we had of pleasure in this Hungarian land ! —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here Riideger lies slaughter'd by the Burgundians' hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Of those who enter'd with him not one came out again.**</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then verily to Helfrich ne'er could be greater pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In sooth he ne'er had carried news so unwillingly ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The messenger to Dietrich went weeping bitterly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" What hast thou," then said Dietrich, " for us discovered ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wherefore, warrior Helfrich, thy tears so freely shed ? "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Good cause have I for weeping," answer'd the noble thane :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Good Riideger is lying by the Burgundians slain." *</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The knight of Bern made answer : " God grant that may not be !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That were a fearful vengeance, and foul fiend's pleasantry :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Howe'er were such requital deserved by Riideger ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For well am I persuaded he held the strangers dear."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereto made Wolf hart answer : " If they this deed have done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It verily shall cost them the life of everyone !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To us 'twould be disgraceful if this we were to stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Riideger has served us right often with his hand."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Amelung's chieftain bade them better informed to be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meanwhile within his window right mournfully sat he ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Hildebrand enjoin'd he unto the guests to go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he whate'er had happen'd from them might surely know.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That warrior bold in battle, the ancient Hildebrand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor shield nor any weapon took with him in his hand ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He to the guests was going in courtesy alone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sore were the upbraidings made by his sister's son.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For spake the fiery Wolf hart : " Wilt thou so simply go ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then certes some misusage thou wilt not fail to know !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, full of grief and trouble, thou needs must homeward fare :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if thou takest thy weapons they each will have a care."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then did the ancient gird him e'en as the stripling bade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But lo ! before he knew it, in fighting gear array'd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were standing Dietrich's warriors, with drawn sword everyone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This thing the hero liked not, and gladly had forgone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He asked where they were going. " Along with you we'll fare !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance Hagen of Tronje so much the less may dare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With mocking speech to meet you, — which well he knows to use."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When that he heard, the warrior no longer could refuse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The gallant Volker saw them in armour fully dight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those knights of Bern come marching, all Dietrich's men of might ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their swords were girt upon them, they carried shield in hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto his lords he told it of the Burgundian land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the fiddle-player : " Yonder I see them go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The followers of Dietrich, — in semblance of a foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With weapons and in helmets : us mean they to withstand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I trow for us poor exiles misfortune is at hand."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>E'en at the self-same moment came Hildebrand to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at his feet his buckler he set upon its rim.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The followers of Gunther to question then he sought :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"Alas ! what harm, good heroes, to you hath Riideger wrought?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Me hath my master Dietrich sent unto you to say :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>* If any one among you hath by his hand this day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid low the noble margrave, — as we are told by some, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An injury so grievous we ne'er could overcome.' "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Hagen spake of Tronj^ : "No lie the tidings are ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though fain I were to grant you, for love of Riideger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they had lied who told you, and he were still in life :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He must be ever wept for by man and maid and wife."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When all knew, of a surety, that Riideger was dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The warriors bewail'd him, as love and fealty bade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From each of Dietrich's liegemen one saw the tears-drops fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O'er chin and beard descending : sore was the grief of all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Siegestab outspeaking, — the duke from Bern, — said he :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Forever now is ended the hospitality</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Riideger aye show'd us after our days of pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Comfort of the exile lies by you heroes slain."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then from among the Amelungs, the warrior Wolfwin said :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' Were I this day before me to see my father dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ne'er could I feel more sorrow than at this stricken life :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas ! who now will comfort the worthy margrave's wife ? "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereon in mood of anger the thane Sir Wolf hart cried :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Who on so many a foray shall now the warriors guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As heretofore the margrave hath times right often done ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas, most noble Riideger, that thou from us art gone ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There Helferich and Wolfbrand and Helmot also were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all their friends, bewailing the death of Riideger ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Hildebrand for sobbing could ask no more of aught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He spake: "Now do ye, warriors, that which my lord hath sought,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>** Give Riideger's dead body to us from out the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With whom, in very sorrow, our joys are ended all ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let us now requite him for all that he hath done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For us, in faithful friendship, and many another one.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" We also here are strangers, Hke the thane Riideger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why do ye keep us waiting ? Let us his body bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Away, to him our servite e'en after death to give :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far rather had we done it, whilst he were yet alive ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>** No service is so worthy," then the King Gunther spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' As that for a dead comrade a friend doth undertake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And steadfast faith I call it, where'er the same I find.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye pay him honour rightly, to you he hath been kind."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" How long must we be pleading ? " Wolfhart the warrior said :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Since our best Consolation by you is stricken dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we, alas ! no longer the good thereof may have.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So let us take the chieftain and lay him in his grave."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereto made answer Volker : " He shall be given by none !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to the hall and take him, here where the thane, fordone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With deadly wounds disfigured, lies in the bloody pool :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That were to do your duty to Riideger in full."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereon bold Wolfhart answer'd : *' Sir Minstrel, God doth know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No need have ye to taunt us, ye've done us harm enow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Durst I offend my master, you'd be the worse for this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we must pass it over, since strife forbidden us is."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the fiddle-player : " Fear claims too much, I trow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all that is forbidden a man must needs forego ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By me that were not reckon'd a right good hero's mood ! "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The speech of his companion seemed unto Hagen good.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"That shall not serve your purpose," Wolfhart in answer spake :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'll so untune your fiddle that you a tale may take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along with you, when homewards unto the Rhine you ride ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot brook with honour your overweening pride."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the fiddle-player : "If thou a fiddlestring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of mine untuneful makest, thy helmet's glittering</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must speedily be lessen'd and clouded by my hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Howe'er betide my riding to the Burgundian land."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He would have sprung upon him, if he had not been stay'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Hildebrand his uncle, who hands upon him laid :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this thy senseless anger thou wouldst, I trow, go mad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so my master's favour might'st never moue have had."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Let go the lion, master ! fierce though he be of mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comes he into my clutches," said Volker, warrior good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" E'en though a world of people he with his hands hath slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'll kill him, that the story he ne'er may tell again."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By this was sorely quicken'd the Berners' angry mood ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Wolfhart clutch'd his buckler, a ready knight and good :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>E'en Hke a savage lion in front of them he rush'd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whilst following close behind him his friends the onset push'd.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet though he sprang so swiftly, to reach the palace wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He could not on the stairway old Hildebrand forestall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who would not that another first in the fight should be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their guerdon from the strangers they both got presently.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then quickly upon Hagen sprang Master Hildebrand :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The clashing of the sword-blades was heard on either hand ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their wrath was sorely kindled, as presently was plain ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fiery stream was scatter'd from ofi" their weapons twain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet quickly were they sunder'd under the stress of fight :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The men of Bern so caused it, prevailing in their might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereon away from Hagen betook him Hildebrand ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And needs must gallant Volker stout Wolfhart's onset stand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He smote the fiddle-player upon his helmet good.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So bravely that the sword-edge unto the sidebands hew'd ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fiddler bold repaid him with all his might and main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And laid his blows on Wolfhart, until he reel'd again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They struck from the mail-armour of fiery sparks enow ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their hate for one another was felt in every blow ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came the warrior Wolf win of Bern the twain between :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had he not been a hero that never could have been.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The warrior Gunther also gave with unstinting hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A welcome to the heroes far-famed of Amelung land ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Giselher the lordly made helms that shone before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On head of many a warrior, ruddy and wet with gore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Dankwart, Hagen's brother, a fearsome man was he :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whatever he, already, on Etzel's chivalry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In battle had accomplish'd, e'en as the wind was naught :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The son of the bold Aldrian now like a madman fought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Richart and Gerbart likewise, Helfrich and eke Wichart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who oftentimes in battle right well had play'd their part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now plainly show'd their prowess to Gunther's fighting men ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wolf brand in combat proudly was seen to bear him then,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And like a madman raging fought ancient Hildebrand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full many a doughty warrior then fell by Wolf hart's hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death-stricken by his sword-blows, into the pool of blood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus Riideger avenged they, these gallant knights and good.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then fought the noble Siegstab as of his might was due ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ha ! and upon his foemen what goodly helmets too</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were shiver'd in the battle by Dietrich's sister's son ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He could not in the struggle e'er better work have done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereon the sturdy Volker, as soon as he beheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How from the tough mail-armour the blood in streamlets well'd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At gallant Siegstab's sword-strokes, the hero's wrath arose ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forward he sprang to meet him : and so his life to lose</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the spot had Siegstab through that same fiddle-man ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who forthwith of his cunning to give such proof began</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That by his mighty weapon quick death must needs ensue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old Hildebrand avenged him, as of his strength was due.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*'Woe, for my lord beloved !" cried Master Hildebrand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Who here in death is lying stricken by Volker's hand :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforth this fiddle-player shall save himself no more ! "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bold Hildebrand was wrathful as ne'er he was before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then smote he so at Volker, that far to either wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bands and clasps in pieces were strown about the hafl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From helm and eke from buckler of that same minstrel bold :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so of sturdy Volker the ending there was told.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The liegemen then of Dietrich came thronging to the rout ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They smote till from the hauberks the links flew far about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And splinter'd weapons saw one as high in air they flew ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hot flowing blood in streamlets from out the helms they drew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Hagen, lord of Tronj^, saw Volker lying slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More grievous was his sorrow than all the other pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in this high foregathering he had for man or kin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What vengeance for the hero did Hagen then begin !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" It shall not long advantage the old man Hildebrand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That yonder lies my helpmate slain by the hero's hand, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The veriest good comrade that ever yet I had ! "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He raised his shield, and forward he rush'd with hewing blade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile the stalwart Helfrich had stricken Dankwart low.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Giselher and Gunther grievous it was enow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When in the stress of battle they saw him fall beneath :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his own hands already he had avenged his death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now all this while did Wolfhart stride up and down again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with his sword unresting he hew'd at Gunther's men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A third time he the journey had made along the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many were the warriors doom'd by his hand to fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Giselher the lordly to Wolfhart loudly spake :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>*' Woe ! that so fierce a foeman 'twas e'er my luck to make !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O noble knight and gallant, now turn thyself to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'll do my best to end it : it may no longer be."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Giselher, in fighting, then Wolfhart turn'd him round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each upon the other made many a gaping wound :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With such a mighty onset against the king he dash'd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blood beneath his footsteps above his head was splash'd.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With swift and deadly sword-strokes the son of Ute fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave greeting unto Wolfhart, the gallant hero, there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How strong the thane soever, he was not to be saved :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So young a king could never more boldly have behaved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He struck a blow at Wolfhart, cleaving the hauberk good.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over him and downwards, gush'd from the wound the blood •</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the death he wounded that man of Dietrich's own ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None but a very warrior to do the like had known.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as gallant Wolfhart was of the wound aware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He let his shield slip downwards ; but higher in the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A weapon strong he wielded : it was a keen one too ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewith through helm and hauberk the hero Giselher slew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So had they one another to cruel death fordone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then of Dietrich's lieges there lived but one alone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Hildebrand the ancient beheld how Wolfhart fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I trow, until his ending, such grief he ne'er could tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The men-at-arms of Gunther were dead now everyone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As likewise those of Dietrich ; and Hildebrand had gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the place where Wolfhart was lying in the blood :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within his arms he folded that warrior brave and good.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fain would he from the chamber have borne him bodily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he was all too weighty, he e'en must let him lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dying man uplifted his eyes amid the blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saw well that his kinsman would help him if he could.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" My well-beloved uncle," the dying one then said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" At this time it avails not to give me any aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now ware you well of Hagen ! ay, take my words for good ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in his heart he nurses an ever cruel mood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" If after death my kinsfolk for me should mourning be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto my next and dearest I bid you say for me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they for me must weep not : need for it is there none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here lie I slain in honour, by kingly hands fordone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" So throughly here, moreover, have I avenged my life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That cause indeed for wailing hath many a good knight's wife ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If anyone should ask you so may you answer plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A good five score are lying whom I myself have slain."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile had Hagen likewise upon the minstrel thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom Hildebrand the valiant unto his end had brought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then spake he to the warrior : " My loss thou shalt requite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here thou hast bereft us of many a goodly knight."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He struck a blow at Hildebrand, such that one might have told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hissing sound of Balmung, the sword that Hagen bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Siegfried's self had taken when he that hero slew ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blow the old man parried : ay ! he was valiant too.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The warrior of Dietrich against the Tronian knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His weapon broad uplifted, that keenly too could smite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wound the man of Gunther yet might he not prevail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then once again smote Hagen through well-wrought coat of mail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now when the old Sir Hildebrand was of the wound aware.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More evil yet he dreaded from Hagen's hand to bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His shield the man of Dietrich threw back behind his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, desperately wounded, the chief from Hagen fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of all the knightly warriors remain'd there but a pair, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save Gunther's self and Hagen none others living were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old Hildebrand all bleeding in flight had safety sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when he came to Dietrich a woeful tale he brought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He saw his master sitting with visage woe-begone, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The prince was yet more sorry when he his tale had done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the bloody hauberk of Hildebrand look'd he.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sought of him his tidings in all anxiety.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now tell me, Master Hildebrand, why are ye in this state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reeking with your life-blood ? or who hath done you that ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I ween that in the palace you with the guests have fought :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So strictly I forbade it that ye in nowise ought."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Unto his lord he answer'd : *' 'Twas Hagen did it all !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He set on me and gave me this wound within the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>E'en as I from the warrior to turn myself began.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hither from that devil barely with life I ran ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he of Bern made answer : " Ye are but served aright !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing that ye had heard me swear friendship with the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then ye break the peace-pledge granted to him by me :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would it not ever shame me your life should forfeit be."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now be ye not so wrathful, my good Lord Dietrich, pray !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On me and on my kinsfolk the loss too hard doth weigh.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We purposed from the palace to carry Riideger ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To grant it all unwilling King Gunther's liegemen were."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now woe upon such tidings ! is Riideger then dead ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is the greatest sorrow that e'er I suffered.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble Gotelinda is child of aunt of mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay ! woe for the poor orphans who at Bechlaren pine."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His death weigh'd sorely on him, with ruth and sorrow great.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He fell to bitter weeping ; sad was the hero's strait :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Woe for my trusty helpmate who now is lost to me !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay ! of King Etzel's liegeman the like I ne'er shall see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now must ye, Master Hildebrand, tell me the story true.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which of the warriors was it who him so foully slew ? "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" That did the stalwart Gemot by strength of arm," he said :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" By Riideger's hand the hero is also lying dead."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Hildebrand then spake he : "Now let my liegemen know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they must straightway arm them, for thither will I go ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bid them bring me hither my shirt of shining mail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the Burgundian heroes myself I'll have the tale."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Hildebrand made answer : "Who shall now go with thee ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None others hast thou living but what thou here dost see ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am thine only liegeman ; the others all are dead."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He shudder'd at these tidings — in sooth, there was good need,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For never such great sorrow he in this world had known.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He spake : " And if my liegemen are truly dead and gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then am I God-forsaken, I, Dietrich, wretched wight !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Erewhile a noble sovran and full of power and might."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" How could such thing have happened ? " spake Dietrich once again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"These far-renowndd heroes, — that all of them are slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By men with fighting weary, in sore necessity !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But for mine evil fortune, death still afar would be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Seeing my doom avails not to ward from me this ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now tell me, of the guest-folk are any living still ? "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Master Hildebrand answer'd : " God knoweth, only twain —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hagen to wit, and Gunther the noble king — remain."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Dear Wolfhart, woe betide me ! if thou from me art torn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too quickly may I rue me that ever I was born !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Siegestab and Wolfwin, and none the less Wolfbrand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who now shall help my journey back to the Amelungs' land ?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Helfrich the ever gallant, and have they laid him low ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gerebart and Wichart, — how weep for them enow ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all my joy and pleasure the ending is this day :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fain would I die for sorrow — alas that no man may ! "</span>
