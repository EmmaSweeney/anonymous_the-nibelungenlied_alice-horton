			<h2>ADVENTURE IV.— -HOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT THE SAXONS.</h2>

139- 
And now, behold, strange tidings have come to Gunther's land, 
And heralds from a distance arrive at the command 
Of warriors unheard of and yet who hatred bore. 
And when the three kings heard it their grief, in sooth, was sore. 



IV.] HOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT THE SAXONS. 25 

140. 
These warriors' names I'll tell you : the first was Lud'ger hight, 
Out of the Saxon country, a rich king of great might ; 
And Ludegast came with him, who was of Denmark king ; — 
These twain brought many with them, a princely following. 

141. 

To Gunther's land the heralds their ready steps had bent, 
Whom those kings, his opponents, had with their message sent. 
The unknown men were questioned as to the news they brought, 
And, summoned by King Gunther, the royal presence sought. 

142. 

The king did greet them fairly ; " Be welcome here," quoth he, 
" Though who hath sent you hither is yet unknown to me : 
That must I hear now of you," declared the monarch good. 
Exceedingly they feared King Gunther's angry mood. 

143- 
" If thou, O king, allowest, the message we'll reveal 
Which we are sent to bring thee, and nothing will conceal. 
We'll name to you the masters who've sent us to this strand : 
Lud'gast and Lud'ger, namely, who would invade your land. 

144. 

" Ye have incurred their anger, nor shun we here to state 
That both our masters harbour for you the greatest hate. 
They mean to come with armies to Worms upon the Rhine : 
And many warriors aid them ; — so warn we thee and thine. 

145- 
" Within twelve weeks their journey must here accomplished be. 
If you've good friends to help you, you'll seek them speedily 
To guard your land and castles, and fight in battlefield. 
By them will here be cloven full many a helm and shield.

146. 
" Or, if ye will treat with them, so make your offer : then 
They will not bring upon you their hosts of arm^d men, 
All bitter foes unto you, to work you grievous woe. 
Destroying your fair knighthood with many a deadly blow." 

147. 
" Now tarry here a little," replied the monarch good, 
" Until I have bethought me, — then shall ye learn my mood. 
If I have faithful subjects I must not hide this thing ; 
This grievous errand must I unto my lieges bring." 

148. 
Rich as he was, to Gunther it was a trouble sore ; 
Within his heart the matter he pondered o'er and o'er. 
He sent in quest of Hagen, and others of his men, 
And bade them from the palace to fetch King Gemot then. 

149. 
His worthiest came unto him, all that were found to hand. 
He spake : " The foeman cometh here into this our land, 
Bringing a mighty army ; to work you all much woe." 
To which the bold knight Gemot made answer : " Nay, not so, 

150. 
"Our good swords shall defend us !" undaunted Gemot said; 
" None but the doomed die, ever, — and they're as good as dead ! 
For fear of death, I'll never forget mine honour dear. 
Let the foe come, and welcome ! they'll find us ready here ! 

Then Hagen spake, of Tronjd : " The thing doth bode no good ; 

Lud'gast and Lud'ger both are too arrogant of mood. 

The time's too short to gather, and furnish all our men ; 

Ye must advise with Siegfried." Thus spake the bold Hagen.

152. 
They bade men take the heralds, and lodge them in the town. 
However hostile to them, for sake of his renown 
Gunther would have them cared for, as was their due and right; 
Until he knew what friends would stand by him in the fight. 

153- 
Yet the king's heart was heavy and sad with anxious care. 
But one beheld him mourning, — a gallant knight and fair, 
Who knew not of the sorrow that had befall'n the king ; — 
Therefore besought he Gunther to declare to him this thing. 

154. 
" To me it is a marvel," quoth Siegfried (for 'twas he), 
" How all your merry custom hath changed utterly, 
Which was the rule among us, and hath so long held sway ? ** 
To which, in answer, Gunther, the comely knight did say ; 

155- 
" Not unto every comer would I the grief declare, 
Which close within my bosom in secret I must bear : 
One keeps one's deepest sorrow for stedfast friends," he said. 
At this did Siegfried's colour change quick, 'twixt white and red. 

156. 
" I never have denied you," he spake unto the king ; — 
" And shall not, in this trouble, my strong arm succour bring ? 
If you for friends are seeking, lo, am I not your friend ? 
I trust to be so ever, — with honour, till mine end." 

157. 
'* Now God reward you, Siegfried, for what you now have said. 
And though your strength should never be needed in mine aid, 
Yet doth this news rejoice me, that you my friend will be ; — 
And you shall ne'er regret it, if life be granted me. 



28 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

158. 

" And you shall hear the reason wherefore I now am sad : 
From enemies, by heralds, this message I have had : 
That they will, with their armies, assail us, at our door ; — 
The like no warriors ever did in these lands before." 

159- 
" Let not your heart be troubled," quoth Siegfried, thereunto ; 
" And calm your anxious spirit, and as I pray you, do ! 
Leave it to me to win you honour and vantage both, 
And bid your thanes come hither to aid you, nothing loth. 

160. 

" Although your mighty foemen should have at their command 
Full thirty thousand swordsmen, yet would I them withstand. 
Though I had but a thousand : so leave this all to me." 
"For this," said Gunther, " ever your debtor I shall be." 

161. 

" So let a thousand warriors at my disposal be, 
Since I of mine own following, have only here with me 
A dozen knights, all reckoned : thus will I guard your land, 
And faithfully at all times shall serve you Siegfried's hand. 

162. 

" In this must Hagen help us, his nephew Ortwein too, 
Dankwart and Sindold also, all knights beloved of you. 
And Volker shall ride with us, Volker the gallant man, 
A better one I know not, and he shall lead the van. 

163. 
" And let the heralds ride back home to their masters' land ; 
And that they soon shall see us give them to understand, 
That peace within our castles may undisturbed reign." 
For followers and kinsmen the king then sent amain. 



IV.] HOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT THE SAXONS. 29 

164. 

The messengers of Lud'ger straightway to court repair. 
At news of home-returning greatly rejoiced they were. 
The good King Gunther gave them rich gifts to take away, 
And promised them safe conduct : right glad of heart were they. 

165. 

" Say now," King Gunther bade them, " unto my foes who come, 
They'd best forego this journey, and stay content at home. 
But, if they be determined to seek me in my land, 
Unless my good friends fail me, they'll find their work to hand." 

166. 
Rich presents then they, straightway, before the heralds bore, 
Gunther was rich in treasure, and had enough and more ; 
These men of Lud'ger's durst not refuse the offered fee, 
And when they leave had taken, departed joyfully. 

167. 
Now when they unto Denmark returned were at last, 
And had declared the tidings unto King Ludegast, 
Which they had brought from Rhineland, and all to him was said, 
The proud and haughty answer filled him with grief and dread. 

168. 

They said that by the Rhine dwelt full many a gallant wight : 

" Among them, with King Gunther, there was a certain knight, 

Who bore the name of Siegfried, — a knight of Netherland." 

Sore grieved was Lud'gast when he this news did understand. 

169. 
As soon as they of Denmark had heard the news of war, 
They made all haste to gather their friends from near and far, 
Till Ludegast could reckon on twenty-thousand men, 
All warriors bold, and ready the war-march to begin. 



30 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

170. 

King Ludeger the Saxon assembled his men, too, 
Till he had forty thousand or even more to show, 
Ready to join the others, and ride to Burgundy. 
Nor was King Gunther idle at home, for also he 

171- 
Sent word to all his kinsmen, and to his brothers' men, 
To bid their troops assemble to go to battle then ; 
And likewise Hagen's warriors, — the heroes needed all. 
Whereby must many a chieftain in death, thereafter, fall. 

172. 

So made they all things ready. When perfect was each plan, 
The gallant warrior, Volker, was bade to lead the van, 
And thus they rode together from Worms, upon the Rhine. 
The chief command to Hagen of Tronje they assign. 

173. 
With them did ride' Sir Sindold, and eke the brave Hunold, 
Two knights of whom was either well worth King Gunther's gold ; 
And Dankwart, Hagen's brother, his nephew Ortwein too, 
Who also might with honour upon the war-march go. 

174. 

" Sir king," said Siegfried, " prithee, in quiet bide at home, 
Seeing that all thy warriors with me to battle come, 
Remain to guard the women, and aye be of good cheer : 
I trow I can take care of your honour and your gear ! 

175. 
" From those who would assail you, at Worms upon the Rhine, 
I'll see that nought of evil befall or thee or thine. 
So closely will we press them, and compass them so near. 
That all their braggart boasting shall soon be changed to fear." 



IV.] HOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT THE SAXONS. 3 1 

176. 
From Rhine they rode through Hesse, their warriors as well, 
Towards the Saxon country,— where they to fighting fell. 
They ravaged all the borders and spoiled with sword and brand, 
Till fear fell on those princes, who sorrowed for their land. 

177. 
So came they o'er the marches ; their followers pressed on, 
And then the gallant Siegfried began to think thereon : 
"Who shall defend our camp-folk, now we have brought them here? 
More damage-wreaking raiders to Saxons never were." 

178. 
Some counselled : "On the march let bold Dankwart guard our youth; 
He is a trusty warrior, and swift in act, forsooth : 
Let him and also Ortwein have conduct of the rear ; 
So shall we have less damage from Lud'ger's men to fear." 

179. 
" Then I myself will ride on," did gallant Siegfried cry. 
And keep the foremost outlook, till we the foe espy ; 
Until I find out where these same crafty warriors lurk." 
Fair Sieglind's son then quickly donned helmet and hauberk. 

180. 
The rank and file to Hagen he entrusted as he went, 
And also unto Gemot, the warrior excellent. 
Then all alone forth rode he into the Saxon-land ; 
That very day his sword hewed full many a helmet-band. 

181. 
He saw a whole vast army upon the plain outspread, 
By which his own few helpers were far outnumbered : 
There were full forty thousand, or even more, maybe ; — 
But when Sir Siegfried saw them, his heart was full of glee 1 



32 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

182. 
On the foe*s side a warrior had to the front been sent, 
Who on his guard stood ready, watchful and diligent. 
The hero Siegfried saw him, and the bold man saw him : 
And each did watch the other, with jealous hate and grim, 

183. 
I'll tell you who it was, who thus sentinel did stand : 
(A shining shield of red gold was hanging on his hand,) 
King Ludegast it was who his army thus did guard, — 
The noble guest spurred forward to meet him on the sward. 

184. 

King Ludegast had also his enemy espied, 

And each sharp spurs had driven into his stallion's side. 

With lances on the shields bent each charged with all his might, 

And Ludegast the mighty was soon in sorry plight. 

185. 
After the crash, the chargers bore the two princes by, 
As if a mighty storm-wind had blown them furiously. 
Till each, the rein obeying, was turned in knightly way ; 
Then did the two grim foemen with swords their skill essay. 

186. 

The mighty strokes of Siegfried made all the field resound, 
Until King Lud'gast's helmet seemed flaming all around, — 
The fire-red sparks shot upwards beneath the hero's hand. 
Each knight found in his fellow a foeman worth his brand. 

187. 
King Lud'gast dealt him also right many an ugly blow : 
Their good shields caught the sword-thrusts, that else had laid 

them low. 
Of Lud'gast's warriors, thirty were witness of the fray. 
But, ere they came to aid him, Siegfried had gained the day. 



IV.] HOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT THE SAXONS. 33 

188. 
From three great wounds and ghastly, which to the king he dealt 
Clean through his white, steel harness ; — though it was firmly welt, — 
Where the keen sword-point entered burst from his wounds 

the blood. 
King Ludegast might well be thereat of doleful mood ! 

189. 
He begged for life ; and offered to pledge to him his land, 
Telling him that 'twas Lud'gast whose fate was in his hand. 
And then uprode his warriors, who witnessed had right well 
What, 'twixt the twain before them, upon the watch, befell. 

190. 
Siegfried now thence would take him ; but he was set upon 
By thirty of the foemen : yet did he hold his own. 
And kept his wealthy captive ; and struck out, brave and true, 
And gave those stately chieftains much bitter cause to rue. 

191. 
In self-defence, the thirty he thereupon did slay. 
One only left he living ; who spurred his steed away 
To bear the direful tidings of all that there befell : 
Which eke his bloody helmet did but too plainly tell. 

192. 
When to the men of Denmark the dreadful news was told, — 
Howthat theirking was taken, — they scarce their grief could hold. 
And when they told his brother, he fell to rave like mad, 
In uncontrolled fury, — so great the grief he had. 

193- 
So Ludegast the warrior was captive made, and then 
Led from the field by Siegfried, and giv'n to Gunther's men. 
To Hagen's care they gave him ; and when they heard the truth, 
That 'twas the king he brought them, — they did not grieve, forsooth !

194. 
The banner of Burgundia was fixed its staff unto. 
" Come on, my men ! " cried Siegfried, " here have we more to do. 
Before the day be ended. If God preserve my life, 
There'll weep among the Saxons full many a comely wife ! 

195- 
"Give ear, ye Rhine-born heroes, unto these words I say: 
To Lud'ger's host I, truly, can show ye straight the way. 
Ye'll see some helmet-hewing by heroes' hands, I trow ! 
And, ere we turn us homewards, what grief is some shall know." 

196. 

To horse did Gemot hasten, as eke did all his men. 
Aloft upbore the banner the stalwart minstrel-thane, — 
The high-born noble Volker ; — before the host he rode ; 
And eke the camp-folk, following, proudly to battle strode. 

197. 
They had no more, all counted, than just a thousand men 
And twelve, with those of Siegfried. The dust 'gan rising then 
Upon the streets and roadways, as through the land they rode : 
One saw their lances shining, and many a good shield glowed. 

198. 
Now also had the Saxons come forth in great array. 
Their swords were finely sharpened, as I have heard men say ; 
And keen they were and deadly, wielded by heroes' hands : 
Therewith they, from the strangers, would castle guard and lands. 

199. 
The marshal of the Rhine-men led on his warriors then. 
And Siegfried followed closely, with the twelve valiant men 
Whom he had brought as comrades from out the Netherland. 
That day in blood of battle was stained many a hand. 



IV.] HOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT THE SAXONS. 35 

200. 
For Sindold's might, and Hunold's, and Gernot's had laid 
In course of that fell combat, full many a hero dead, 
Ere they had time to reckon the valour of the foe. 
And many a winsome lady that day must weep for woe. 

201. 
Sir Volker and Sir Hagen, and also Ortewein, 
Dimmed in that strife the light that from many a helm did shine, 
With damp of blood downpouring, — these battle-valiant men ! 
Sir Dankwart's prowess also wrought many a marvel then. 

202. 
And also they of Denmark did well their weapons wield, 
And many a thrust resounded on many a polish'd shield ; 
And the sharp sword-strokes echoed death-dealing, blow on blow. 
The warlike Saxons likewise did harm enough, I trow ! 

203. 

As now the bold Burgundians, pressed forward in the fight, 
By them was many a sword-wound, wide-cleft, — a ghastly sight ! 
And streaming o'er the saddles, one saw the reeking blood. 
Thus fought they for dear honour, those valiant knights and good. 

204. 
One heard there, loud-resounding, from every hero's hand, 
The clashing of keen weapons ; whilst they of Netherland 
Dashed after their bold leader, into the thickest fray. 
Right valiantly they followed where Siegfried showed the way. 

205. 
For him the Rhenish heroes could never come anigh ; — 
One might have seen down-flowing red streamlets bloodily 
Beneath the glitt'ring helmets, cloven by Siegfried's hand ; — 
Until he saw King Lud'ger before his warriors stand.

206. 
Three sev'ral times he'd traversed the host, from end to end, 
And now, to help him, Hagen his steps did thither bend. 
Right well in fight assuaged they the fierceness of their mood : 
Through them that day must perish full many a warrior good. 

207. 
Wh-en Ludeger the stalwart saw Siegfried near him stand, 
And how aloft he wielded the good sword in his hand, — 
The mighty weapon Balmung, — and what a host it slew : 
The king waxed very wrathful, and fierce his anger grew. 

208. 
Then was a mighty thronging, cind clang of swords as well, 
As on each side the warriors on their opponents fell. 
The chieftains sought each other, mettle and strength to gauge ; — 
The hosts began to waver ; then waxed the hate and rage. 

209. 
The leader of the Saxons was well aware, I trow, 
His brother was a captive, — and therefore grieved enow. 
He knew too that the captor was Siegelinda's son ; — 
'Twas first set down to Gemot, but soon the truth was known. 

210. 
So fierce was Lud'ger's onslaught, and eke of such fell force, 
That under Siegfried's saddle stagger'd his battle-horse. 
But soon it did recover ; and, as the turmoil grew, 
The aspect of bold Siegfried was terrible to view. 

211. 
Hagen he had to aid him, and Gemot too was by. 
And Dankwart and Sir Volker ; — the dead around did lie. 
There fought the bold thane Ortwein, and Sindold, and Hunold. 
Who, on the field of battle, left many a warrior cold. 



IV.] HOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT THE SAXONS. -^^J 

212. 

In combat undivided these noble princes were ; 
And o'er their helmets, harmless, flew many a well-aimed spear 
Between the glitt'ring targets from each opposing knight. 
And blood-stained were thebucklers that whilom shone so bright. 

213. 
And, in the stress of battle, full many an eager knight 
Dismounted from his charger. Thus, hand to hand, did fight 
Siegfried the bold, and Lud'ger, who each did each defy. 
One saw the broken splinters of shafts and lances fly. 

214. 
Fast flew the shield-clasps, severed by mighty Siegfried's hand. 
He thought himself the victor, this prince of Netherland, 
Over the dauntless Saxons \ — so many wounded lay. 
Ha, how the bright mail-armour at Dankwart's strokes did fray ! 

215. 
Just then the Saxon Lud'ger espied upon a shield 
A kingly crown emblazoned, which Siegfried's arm did wield. 
Then knew he, of a surety, that 'twas the mighty man. 
The chieftain to his comrades loudly to call began : 

216. 
" Forego your fighting, warriors, — my lieges, all is done ! 
For here have I seen Siegfried, the royal Siegmund's son ; — 
Siegfried the mighty hero mine eyes have seen, I trow, — 
Sent by some evil devil to work us Saxons woe." 

217. 
Then lowered were the ensigns at Ludeger's command. 
For peace he sued ; which, erelong, was granted to his band; 
Though he as Gunther's pris'ner must go to Burgundy : 
Bold Siegfried's hand alone 'twas that won this victory. 



38 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

218. 
By general agreement the combat then was stopped, 
And many a battered buckler was by the fighters dropped, 
And many a helm ; — whatever was found upon the land, 
Bore on it blood-red traces of some Burgundian hand. 

219. 

They captured whom they listed : all had they in their power. 
And King Gemot and Hagen, — of chivalry the flower, — 
Had the sick borne on litters ; and, with them, took they then. 
As prisoners to the Rhineland, five hundred goodly men. 

220. 
Meanwhile the vanquished warriors to Denmark rode away. 
Nor could the Saxons boast of much better luck than they, 
That any one need praise them : sore vexed these heroes were. 
The friends, too, of the fallen bewailed them, in despair. 

221. 

They had their arms and weapons unto the Rhine conveyed. 
How well now all had ended ! With his brave warriors' aid 
Siegfried the prince had done it, as he did all things, well : 
Which even Gunther's liegemen were bound in truth to tell. 

222. 
To Worms a message firstly the gallant Gemot sent, 
To let his friends and kinsmen know how the matter went, 
And what success had crowned them, — him and his lieges all : 
For honour had they striven, and gallantly withal. 

223. 
The young esquires ran quickly, and soon the news was told. 
And they for joy exulted, — whom grief before did hold, — 
At these all-welcome tidings, which to the city came. 
And many were the questions asked by each noble dame : 



IV.] HOW SIEGFRIED FOUGHT THE SAXONS. 39 

224. 
" How had they fared, the warriors of the most noble king ? " 
One of the squires they, straightway, before Kriemhilda bring : 
But this was done in secret, she took no open part, — 
Though there was one among them to whom was pledged her heart. 

225. 
^And when she saw the envoy into her chamber led, 
Kriemhild, the beauteous maiden, in voice most kindly said : 
" Now tell me the dear tidings and gold I'll give to thee ; — 
And tell'st thou with no lying, a friend thou hast in me. 

226, 
" How fared my brother Gemot amid the fight ? " she said, 
" And other friends and kinsmen ? have we left many dead ? 
And who did best of any ? fain would I hear of thee." 
Then outspake that bold herald : " Of cravens none had we ! 

227. 
" Yet, in the thick of battle rode ne'er a man so well, 
Oh, Princess high and mighty, — since I the truth must tell, — 
As did the noble stranger, who came from Netherland : 
Full many a wondrous deed was wrought by bold Siegfried's hand. 

228. 
" For what great feats soever in battle may have done 
Sir Dankwart and Sir Hagen and many another one ; 
Howe'er they fought for honour, it all was idle wind 
Compared with Siegfried's doings, the son of Siegelind. 

229. 

" Though in the strife of battle full many a hero fell. 

The wonders wrought by Siegfried no man hath words to tell ! 

Nor all his deeds of daring when he to battle rode : 

Through him, for fallen kinsmen, the women's tears have flowed.

230. 
"And many a girl's betrothed one ne'er rose from off that ground. 
Upon the brazen helmets one heard his blows resound ; 
And from the death-wounds spurted hot streams of crimson blood : 
In all his acts is Siegfried a gallant knight and good. 

231. 

" What doughty deeds were wrought by Ortwein, of Metz the lord ! 
How ever many foemen he came at with his sword, 
There did he leave them lying — the better part were dead ; 
And yet no less of Gemot, your brother, might be said. 

232. 
" For he did work such ruin as ne'er was seen in fight. 
In truth, one must confess here of each well-proven knight 
Among the proud Burgundians, that they all bravely bore 
Themselves, and kept their honour untarnished evermore. 

"Full many an empty saddle their handiwork did show ; 
And with their bright swords' clashing loud did the field echo. 
The Rhenish heroes truly, so fell a riding made, 
'Twere better for their foemen if they at home had stayed. 

234. 
" The two bold knights of Tronje did work much dire distress, 
What time the charging armies did one another press. 
And many a warrior perished beneath bold Hagen's hand ; — 
There's much to tell of him yet here in Burgundian land. 

235- 
" Sindold and Hunold also, who were King Gernot's men, 
And the bold warrior Runold, such doughty deeds did then. 
That Ludeger the Saxon must rue, until he die, 
That ever he thy kinsmen did on the Rhine defy.

236. 
*' Yet still the best achievement that on that field hath been, 
Or any, from the youngest to the oldest man hath seen, 
Was done in knightly fashion by Siegfried's own right hand. 
Rich hostages he bringeth here, into Gunther's land. 

237- 
"These by sheer strength he vanquished, the brave and goodly 

wight ! 
And Ludegast of Denmark hath suffered great despite, 
And Ludeger his brother, who from the Saxons came. 
Now hearken to my tidings, most rich and noble dame ! 

238. 
" They twain were taken prisoners, and that by Siegfried's hand. 
Never so many captives were brought into this land 
As to the Rhine are coming only for Siegfried's part." 
No news could have been dearer to Lady Kriemhild's heart. 

239- 
" Unwounded captives bring they, — five hundred men and more ; 
And then the deadly- wounded, — of bloody biers fourscore ; — 
Full eighty bloodstained stretchers, my Lady, understand ! 
The better part of these were slain by bold Siegfried's hand. 

240. 
" They who, thus overweening, have flouted us on Rhine, 
Must now, as battle-pris'ners, in Gunther's kingdom pine : 
Yea, even now they bring them with joy unto our land." 
Then sweetly flushed her fair face, as she did understand. 

241. 
Her lovely face, with pleasure, became all rosy red; 
For, by good luck, deliver'd out of the direst need 
Had been her goodly warrior, — the young man, Prince Siegfried ; 
For all her friends rejoiced she, — as she was bound, indeed.

242. 
Then spake the winsome maiden : *'Well hast thou said, and now 
Thou shalt have costly raiment for guerdon, that I owe; 
And ten good golden marks too ; they shall be brought thee here I " 
Such tidings to rich ladies a man would gladly bear ! 

243. 
They gave him for his guerdon the raiment and the gold. 
Then to the windows hastened the fair maids, to behold 
The horsemen up the street come : and, watching eagerly, 
They saw the gallant riders come home to Burgundy. 

244. 
They came, the hale and hearty, the wounded also came. 
They heard the neighbours' greetings, and need not blush for shame. 
The host rode forth rejoicing to meet his guests again : 
It was a joyful ending to all his anxious pain. 

245. 
He welcomed home his warriors, and all the strangers too ; — 
To the great king 'twas fitting not otherwise to do 
Than graciously to tender his thanks to those who came, 
Who had in fight defended the honour of his name. 

246. 
Then Gunther asked for tidings, that he to hear was fain. 
Of those who had returned not, — their comrades who were slain. 
But sixty men were missing, and he had lost no more ; — 
For these they might cease mourning, as for the brave of yore. 

247. 
The men who were unwounded brought many a battered shield, 
And many a dinted helmet, to Gunther from that field. 
Before the royal palace dismounted all the men, 
And, with a shout of gladness, were welcomed home again.

248. 
Twas ordered then to billet the warriors in the town. 
The king bade that his guests be well- treated, as his own. 
The wounded must be cared for and granted quiet rest; — 
E'en for his foes his kindness the king did manifest. -^ 

249. 
To Ludegast of Denmark he said : " Be welcome here ! 
Though, through your fault, much damage we have incurred, I 

fear; 
But that will be repaid me, if I have luck ! " quoth he, 
" May God reward my brave friends, who fought so well for me." 

250. 
"And you do well to thank them," King Ludeger outspake, 
" For never king before did such high-born prisoners take ! 
The honourable usage shall well rewarded be. 
Which unto us, your foemen, you've granted graciously." 

251. 

** I'll let ye both," cried Gunther, " here, on the spot, go free. 
If all the other pris'ners swear to remain with me. 
For these I will have pledges, that they leave not my land 
Without my given warrant." Thereon each gave his hand. 

252. 
All were to rest and comfort within the hostels brought ; 
They put to bed the wounded, with kindly care and thought ; 
While to the hale and hearty good wine and mead they gave. - 
A gayer time and gladder the folk could never have. 

253- 
The battered shields were taken and put away in store. 
Of blood-besprinkled saddles were there enough and more ; — 
The men were told to hide them, in case the women wept. 
Still many a way-worn horseman into the city crept.

254. 
For his guests the king provided with kindness wonderful. 
With strangers and indwellers the land was very full. 
Those who lay sorely wounded he greatly cared for, too. 
'Twas thus the good king humbled his proud and haughty foe. 

255. 
To all well skilled in leechcraft no guerdon was denied. 
Unstinted store of silver and shining gold beside, 
If they could heal the heroes, who wounded were in fight : 
To load his guests with presents was eke this king's delight. 

256. 
If any there were minded to journey home again, 
They, in most friendly fashion, were bidden to remain. 
And then the king took counsel how to reward his men, 
Who had his will accomplished with honour and with pain. 

257. 
The warrior Gemot counselled : " Let these now homeward ride ! 
In six weeks' time we'll bid them, if nothing should betide, 
Return with us to join in a great festivity ; 
By then may they be healed who sorely wounded lie." 

258. 
For leave asked Siegfried likewise, the lord of Netherland ; 
But when the royal Gunther his wish did understand, 
He lovingly entreated his dear friend not to go ; — 
Though, but for Gunther's sister, he would have gone, I trow. 

259- 
Though Siegfried was too wealthy to care for the king's pay, 
Right well had he deserved it. He was his friend alway. 
And eke of all his kinsmen : for had their eyes not seen 
How by his strength in combat the victory had been ?

260. 
For love of the fair maiden he thought he still would stay, — 
Perchance he yet might see her : which came to pass one day, 
Just as he most desired ; — he learnt to know the maid. 
Thereafter to his country right joyously he sped. 

261. 

Each day in knightly contests the host would prove his men : 
Which willingly were practised by many a proud young thane. 
Then had he seats erected by Worms, upon the strand, 
For those whom he awaited in his Burgundian land. 

262. 
About this time, when well-nigh the coming guests were due, 
The beauteous Kriemhilda heard what he had in view : 
That he, with friends, was meaning to keep high festival. 
Then was a great commotion among the fair dames all 

263. 

As to the robes and ribands 'twere best for each to wear. 
Unto the rich queen Ute the tidings straight they bear 
Of the proud stranger-warriors, who now were on their way. 
Then from her presses took she rich clothes and raiment gay. 

264. 
For love of her dear children she had these garments made, 
Wherewith were soon adorned full many a dame and maid, 
And many a bold young hero of the Burgundian land. 
For many strangers, likewise, rich clothes she did command.
