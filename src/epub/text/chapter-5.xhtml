			<h2>ADVENTURE V.— HOW SIEGFRIED FIRST SAW KRIEMHILDA.</h2>

265. 
One saw them daily riding to Worms upon the Rhine, 
The guests who to the revels did joyously incline. 
Those whom the love of Gunther unto his kingdom brought, 
Were freely offered horses, and raiment richly wrought. 

266. 
Seats, ready for all comers, were well and duly made, 
Fit for the best and highest, — as hath to us been said, — 
For two and thirty princes at that festivity ; 
For which fair dames bedecked them in merry rivalry. 

267. 

Then busiest of the busy was Giselher the lad. 
For kinsmen and for strangers a welcome kind he had. 
Receiving them with Gemot ; and every knight and squire 
Was greeted by these warriors, as honour did require. 

268. 
Full many a gilded saddle to Worms these riders brought, 
With richly chased bucklers, and garments finely wrought ; 
They brought them to the Rhineland to grace the festival ; 
And many of the wounded were merry enough withal. 

269. 
For those who on their pallets lay wounded, in distress. 
Must needs, though death were grievous, forget its bitterness, 
And all the sick and ailing, must drive dull care away, 
And join in the rejoicings for this great holiday.

270. 
Was ever such gay living and hospitality ! 
Delights, beyond all measure, and boundless jollity 
Were shared by all the people, and found on every hand. 
And there was joy and gladness throughout King Gunther's land. 

271. 
'Twas on a Whitsun morning ; one saw them all go by, 
All festively apparelled, and mounted gallantly : 
Five thousand men, and upwards, to join the revels ride. 
And many a pleasant contest began on ev'ry side. 

272. 
The host was not unmindful, and well did understand 
How heartily and truly the prince of Netherland 
Love-bound was to his sister, whom yet he had not seen ; — 
A match for whom in beauty no maiden yet had been. 

273- 
Then to the king did Ortwein the thane, his thought unfold : 
" If you, with fullest honour, this festival would hold, 
You should allow our brave guests our winsome maids to see 
Who are, in truth, the glory and pride of Burgundy. 



274. 
" For where would man's delight be, and what could charm his life, 
If there were no fair maidens, and ne'er a comely wife ? 
Now, therefore, let your sister before your guests appear." 
This was a pleasing counsel to many a hero's ear ! 

275- 
*' Most gladly will I do this," replied the king, straightway, 
And all who heard his answer had merry hearts that day. 
He sent to summon Ute, and eke her daughter fair. 
And bade them with their maidens at once to court repair.

276. 

Then in their presses sought they for all their garments gay, 
And all the goodly raiment that had been stored away ; 
The gold lace and the bracelets that there to hand were laid ; 
And with all care bedecked her full many a lovely maid. 

277. 
And many a knight on that day had younger gladly been, 
That he might be of women more favourably seen ; 
Instead whereof he'd care not a kingdom rich to own ! 
And gladly did they gaze on these damsels yet unknown ! 

278. 
Then the rich king commanded that with Kriemhild should go 
A hundred of his liegemen, — her service pledged unto. 
Of his and her own kinsmen, who carried sword in hand. 
Such were the court-attendants of the Burgundian land. 

279. 
The rich Queen-mother Ute with her fair daughter came, 
And in her train brought with her full many a comely dame, — 
Five score of them or over, — all royally arrayed. 
Her daughter, too, was followed by many a winsome maid. 

280. 
From out the women's quarters one might have seen them go ; 
There was a goodly thronging of heroes eke, I trow. 
For this of all things eager, if it perchance might be 
That they should have the fortune the noble maid to see, 

281. 
Then came the lovely maiden : even as morning-red 
From sombre clouds outbreaking. And many a sorrow fled 
From him whose heart did hold her, and eke so long had held : 
When thus the winsome fair one before him he beheld.

282. 
Upon her raiment glittered full many a precious stone : 
Her rosy blushing colour with lovely radiance shone. 
Though any would deny it he could not but confess, 
That on this earth he never had seen more loveliness. 

283. 
Just as the moon in brightness excels the brightest stars, 
And, suddenly outshining, athwart the clouds appears; 
So seemed she now, compared with dames of fairest guise. 
Then did our gallant hero feel his bold spirits rise. 

284. 
One saw before her marching the chamberlains, in state, — 
But the high-mettled warriors their order would not wait : 
They thronged to where, in passing, the fair maid they could see. 
The while Sir Siegfried suffered both joy and misery. 

285. 

Sadly he thought within him : " How can it ever be? 
It is mere foolish dreaming that I should marry thee ! 
Yet to be still a stranger ! — then were I better dead ! " 
And, thinking so, his colour did change 'twixt white and red. . 

286. 
There stood the son of Siegmund ; as winsome did he look 
As if his form were limned upon a parchment-book. 
By hand of cunning master ; and all men said of him, 
That there was no man like him, so fine and fair of limb. 

287. 
They who the maid attended now strove to clear the track. 
And keep the throng from pressing ; and many a knight drew back. 
And manly hearts beat quicker for joy, in many a breast, 
As passed each high-born lady in splendid raiment drest.

288. 
Then outspake gallant Gemot, the prince of Burgundy : 
" To him, who such good service so late hath done to thee, 
Thou Gunther, dearest brother, shouldst haste to do the same 
In sight of all thy warriors : I say it without shame. 

289. 
" If thou would'st bid Sir Siegfried unto my sister go. 
That the fair maid may greet him, much good might come, I trow. 
She, who ne'er greeted warrior, may by her greeting cheer ; 
And thus this goodly hero be bounden to us here." 

290. 
Then some of the host's kinsmen went where the knight did stand 
And thus spake to the warrior who came from Netherland : 
" The king his leave hath granted that you to court should go, 
His sister there shall greet you : they would you honour show." 

291. 
At this the knight's mood changed again from grave to gay ; 
And in his heart Love reigned, and grief had fled away,— 
For the fair Ute's daughter at last his eyes would see ! 
Right soon she greeted Siegfried, with winning modesty. 

292. 
When the high-couraged warrior she saw before her there. 
Her cheeks were lit with crimson : then spake the maiden fair : 
** Be welcome here, Sir Siegfried, thou good and noble knight." 
And when he heard her greeting his heart grew wondrous light. 

293. 
He bent him low before her ; she took him by the hand. 
How lover-like the knight did by the fair maiden stand ! 
Each looked upon the other with many a tender glance. 
This hero and his lady, — and yet they looked askance. 



v.] HOW SIEGFRIED FIRST SAW KRIEMHILDA. 5 1 

294. 
Was that white hand, I wonder, in lover's fashion press'd ? 
In sign of tender wooing ? in sooth 'twas ne'er confess'd. 
But scarce can I believe that such chance had been let go ; 
For she her kindness to him did very quickly show. 

295- 
In the full bliss of summer, and in the fair Maytide, 
Within his heart could never, again such joy abide 
As now did fill his bosom ; the while he there did stand, 
And her whom he desired was holding hand in hand. 

296. 
And many a warrior murmured : "Ah, if it only were 
My lot to walk beside her, as I have seen him here, 
Or at her side to lay me, what bliss would mine have been ! " 
Never served hero better, methinks, to win a queen. 

297. 
Whate'er might be the country the strangers call'd their own. 
None had an eye for any save for this pair alone. 
And when they let her kiss him, — the goodly man and brave !— 
In all this world he never a greater joy could have. 

298. 
Then rose the King of Denmark, and suddenly did cry : 
" To bring about this greeting how many wounded lie ! 
Too well have I observed it, — and all by Siegfried's hand ; 
Forefend him, God, from coming again to Danish land ! " 

299. 
On one side and the other they bade the folk make way 
For beauteous lady Kriemhild. Then saw one an array 
Of valiant knights who churchward did bear her company. 
Then could her goodly gallant no longer near her be;

300. 
For she went to the minster, with all her dames beside. 
So fair a sight and queenly was she in all her pride, 
That the high vows of many whilom forgot to rise ; 
And many a hero feasted his soul upon her eyes. 

301. 
Hardly did Siegfried's patience last till the mass was done. 
Yet might he thank his fortune that he such grace had won, 
That she to him inclined, whom in his heart he bore : 
Therefore it was but fitting that he should love her more. 

302. 
As she came from the minster, which he had left before. 
The gallant thane was bidden to join the dame once more. 
Then, first, began to thank him the winsome maid, that he 
Beyond all other warriors had fought so gloriously. 

303. 
" Now God reward you, Siegfried," thus spake the child so fair, 
" Right well have you deserved that all the warriors here 
Do love and serve you truly, as they themselves avow." 
Right tenderly began he to look on Kriemhild now. 

304- 
" For ever will I serve you ! " declared the warrior, 
" Henceforth my head I'll never lay down to rest before 
Your least wish be accomplished, if life be granted me ; 
All this, my lady Kriemhild, for your dear sake shall be." 

305- 
Then, for the space of twelve days, on each new dawning day, 
One saw the lovely maiden beside the knight alway. 
As often as to court she before her friends must go. 
Unto the knight this service did her great love allow. 



v.] HOW SIEGFRIED FIRST SAW KRIEMHILDA. 53 

306. 
All kinds of mirth and pleasure, and mighty noise withal, 
Were seen and heard forthcoming daily from Gunther's hall, — 
Without, and inside also, — from many a gallant man. 
Sir Ortwein and Sir Hagen right wondrous feats began. 

307. 
Whatever games were started these jocund heroes were 
Always among the foremost, a skilled and ready pair. 
Whereby these warriors soon were well known to every guest ; 
Of such kind were the jewels that Gunther's land possessed. 

308. 
Those who had long lain wounded one saw, at last, appear : 
They too would share the pastimes, would fence and throw the 

spear 
Among the king's retainers ; well-pleased to find at length 
That they could do as others; they had renewed their strength. 

309- 
Th e host would have them treated well, at his festal board. 
Theirs was to be the best food. Thus managed he to ward 
The slightest breath of scandal, which oft a king doth reach. 
From guest to guest on went he, with kindly words for each. 

310. 
He said : "All ye, good warriors, before ye ride away, 
I pray ye take my presents : 'twas in my mind alway 
To recompense your service ; my goods despise not ye : 
I fain would share them with you ; this do I willingly." 

311- 

Then did the lords of Denmark thus answer, out of hand : 
" Before we ride hence, homewards unto our fatherland, 
We fain would have a treaty : of peace we knights have need. 
We've lost dear friends in plenty who, through your knights, lie 
dead."

312. 
King Ludegast of Denmark was healed now of his wound, 
And eke the Saxon leader was once more whole and sound. 
Albeit many dead men they left in alien land. 
Then went the royal Gunther to where Siegfried did stand. 

3^3- 
And to the warrior spake he : " Advise what I shall do ; 
For early on the morrow our foes intend to go, 
And crave abiding pledges of peace, from mine and me : 
Now counsel me, thane Siegfried, what seemeth good to thee ? 

314- 
" What ransom they have offered thou shalt be truly told : 
So much as mares five hundred can carry of pure gold. 
This will they give me gladly, if I will set them free." 
Then Siegfried answered stoutly • " That would unworthy be ! 

315- 
" Free, and without a ransom hence shouldst thou let them fare : 
And that these noble warriors henceforward may beware 
How they come hither, riding as foemen to our land. 
Of this in full assurance let both kings give their hand." 

316. 
" This counsel will I follow ! " So saying, forth they went. 
A message to the foemen was soon thereafter sent : 
" The gold, that ye have offered, doth no man care to keep, 
While for the strife-worn warriors at home their dear ones weep." 

317- 
Then many a shield with treasure piled high they carried there : 
Enough, although he weighed not, for every friend to share ; 
Five hundred marks well-counted, yea more, he gave to some. 
This counsel to King Gunther had from bold Gemot come. 



v.] HOW SIEGFRIED FIRST SAW KRIEMHILDA. 55 

318. 
Then took they leave, for all were impatient to be gone ; 
But first, before Kriemhilda the guests filed, one by one ; 
There sat dame Ute also, the Queen, who bade " God speed " I 
Never before were warriors sped half so well, indeed. 

319- 
The hostels were left empty when they had ridden away. 
Only at home remained the king, in state array 
With all his friends and kinsmen, — full many a noble knight. 
These, day by day, were gladden 'd, by dame Kriemhilda's sight. 

320. 
Now Siegfried, the good hero, did also sue for leave : 
Not hoping more to win her, to whom his heart did cleave. 
The king o'erheard the saying that he would fain away : 
'Twas Giselher who urged him his journey to delay. 

321. 
" Now whither, noble Siegfried, is it thy will to ride ? 
Stay rather, I beseech thee, and with our warriors bide. 
Remain with our King Gunther, and with his men and me ; — 
Are there not here fair women, whom thou hast leave to see ? " 

322. 

Then spake the stalwart Siegfried : **So bide the steeds in stall! 
For I have changed my purpose, I will not ride at all. 
And bear the bucklers hence too ; — I hoped to see my land, 
But Giselher's true friendship I know not to withstand." 

323. 
Thus did the gallant hero remain for friendship's sake. 
And in no other country could he a sojourn make 
That to his soul were sweeter ; — and so it hap'd that he 
On every day thenceforward did fair Kriemhilda see. 



S6 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

324. 
For her surpassing beauty he was content to stay 
And spend the days in pastimes, which whiled the hours away. 
Although her love constrained him, it gave him grievous pain. 
Through it the brave knight, later, was miserably slain.
