			<h2>Adventure V.— HOW SIEGFRIED FIRST SAW KRIEMHILDA.</h2>
			<p>
				<span>One saw them daily riding to Worms upon the Rhine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The guests who to the revels did joyously incline.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those whom the love of Gunther unto his kingdom brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were freely offered horses, and raiment richly wrought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seats, ready for all comers, were well and duly made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fit for the best and highest, — as hath to us been said, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For two and thirty princes at that festivity ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which fair dames bedecked them in merry rivalry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then busiest of the busy was Giselher the lad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For kinsmen and for strangers a welcome kind he had.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Receiving them with Gemot ; and every knight and squire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was greeted by these warriors, as honour did require.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Full many a gilded saddle to Worms these riders brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With richly chased bucklers, and garments finely wrought ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They brought them to the Rhineland to grace the festival ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many of the wounded were merry enough withal.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For those who on their pallets lay wounded, in distress.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must needs, though death were grievous, forget its bitterness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the sick and ailing, must drive dull care away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And join in the rejoicings for this great holiday.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Was ever such gay living and hospitality !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delights, beyond all measure, and boundless jollity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were shared by all the people, and found on every hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there was joy and gladness throughout King Gunther's land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>'Twas on a Whitsun morning ; one saw them all go by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All festively apparelled, and mounted gallantly :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Five thousand men, and upwards, to join the revels ride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a pleasant contest began on ev'ry side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The host was not unmindful, and well did understand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How heartily and truly the prince of Netherland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love-bound was to his sister, whom yet he had not seen ; —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A match for whom in beauty no maiden yet had been.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then to the king did Ortwein the thane, his thought unfold :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" If you, with fullest honour, this festival would hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You should allow our brave guests our winsome maids to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who are, in truth, the glory and pride of Burgundy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" For where would man's delight be, and what could charm his life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If there were no fair maidens, and ne'er a comely wife ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now, therefore, let your sister before your guests appear."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This was a pleasing counsel to many a hero's ear !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>*' Most gladly will I do this," replied the king, straightway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all who heard his answer had merry hearts that day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sent to summon Ute, and eke her daughter fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bade them with their maidens at once to court repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then in their presses sought they for all their garments gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the goodly raiment that had been stored away ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gold lace and the bracelets that there to hand were laid ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with all care bedecked her full many a lovely maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And many a knight on that day had younger gladly been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he might be of women more favourably seen ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instead whereof he'd care not a kingdom rich to own !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gladly did they gaze on these damsels yet unknown !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the rich king commanded that with Kriemhild should go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hundred of his liegemen, — her service pledged unto.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his and her own kinsmen, who carried sword in hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such were the court-attendants of the Burgundian land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The rich Queen-mother Ute with her fair daughter came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in her train brought with her full many a comely dame, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Five score of them or over, — all royally arrayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her daughter, too, was followed by many a winsome maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From out the women's quarters one might have seen them go ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was a goodly thronging of heroes eke, I trow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this of all things eager, if it perchance might be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they should have the fortune the noble maid to see,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then came the lovely maiden : even as morning-red</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From sombre clouds outbreaking. And many a sorrow fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From him whose heart did hold her, and eke so long had held :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thus the winsome fair one before him he beheld.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon her raiment glittered full many a precious stone :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her rosy blushing colour with lovely radiance shone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though any would deny it he could not but confess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That on this earth he never had seen more loveliness.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Just as the moon in brightness excels the brightest stars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, suddenly outshining, athwart the clouds appears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So seemed she now, compared with dames of fairest guise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then did our gallant hero feel his bold spirits rise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One saw before her marching the chamberlains, in state, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the high-mettled warriors their order would not wait :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They thronged to where, in passing, the fair maid they could see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The while Sir Siegfried suffered both joy and misery.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sadly he thought within him : " How can it ever be?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is mere foolish dreaming that I should marry thee !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet to be still a stranger ! — then were I better dead ! "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, thinking so, his colour did change 'twixt white and red.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There stood the son of Siegmund ; as winsome did he look</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if his form were limned upon a parchment-book.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By hand of cunning master ; and all men said of him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That there was no man like him, so fine and fair of limb.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They who the maid attended now strove to clear the track.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And keep the throng from pressing ; and many a knight drew back.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And manly hearts beat quicker for joy, in many a breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As passed each high-born lady in splendid raiment drest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then outspake gallant Gemot, the prince of Burgundy :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" To him, who such good service so late hath done to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou Gunther, dearest brother, shouldst haste to do the same</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In sight of all thy warriors : I say it without shame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" If thou would'st bid Sir Siegfried unto my sister go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the fair maid may greet him, much good might come, I trow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She, who ne'er greeted warrior, may by her greeting cheer ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus this goodly hero be bounden to us here."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then some of the host's kinsmen went where the knight did stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus spake to the warrior who came from Netherland :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" The king his leave hath granted that you to court should go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His sister there shall greet you : they would you honour show."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At this the knight's mood changed again from grave to gay ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in his heart Love reigned, and grief had fled away,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the fair Ute's daughter at last his eyes would see !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right soon she greeted Siegfried, with winning modesty.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the high-couraged warrior she saw before her there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her cheeks were lit with crimson : then spake the maiden fair :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>** Be welcome here, Sir Siegfried, thou good and noble knight."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when he heard her greeting his heart grew wondrous light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He bent him low before her ; she took him by the hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How lover-like the knight did by the fair maiden stand !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each looked upon the other with many a tender glance.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This hero and his lady, — and yet they looked askance.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Was that white hand, I wonder, in lover's fashion press'd ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In sign of tender wooing ? in sooth 'twas ne'er confess'd.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But scarce can I believe that such chance had been let go ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For she her kindness to him did very quickly show.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the full bliss of summer, and in the fair Maytide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within his heart could never, again such joy abide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As now did fill his bosom ; the while he there did stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And her whom he desired was holding hand in hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And many a warrior murmured : "Ah, if it only were</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My lot to walk beside her, as I have seen him here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or at her side to lay me, what bliss would mine have been ! "</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never served hero better, methinks, to win a queen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whate'er might be the country the strangers call'd their own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None had an eye for any save for this pair alone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when they let her kiss him, — the goodly man and brave !—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all this world he never a greater joy could have.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rose the King of Denmark, and suddenly did cry :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" To bring about this greeting how many wounded lie !</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too well have I observed it, — and all by Siegfried's hand ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forefend him, God, from coming again to Danish land ! "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On one side and the other they bade the folk make way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For beauteous lady Kriemhild. Then saw one an array</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of valiant knights who churchward did bear her company.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then could her goodly gallant no longer near her be;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For she went to the minster, with all her dames beside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fair a sight and queenly was she in all her pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the high vows of many whilom forgot to rise ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a hero feasted his soul upon her eyes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hardly did Siegfried's patience last till the mass was done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet might he thank his fortune that he such grace had won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she to him inclined, whom in his heart he bore :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore it was but fitting that he should love her more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As she came from the minster, which he had left before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gallant thane was bidden to join the dame once more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, first, began to thank him the winsome maid, that he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all other warriors had fought so gloriously.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now God reward you, Siegfried," thus spake the child so fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Right well have you deserved that all the warriors here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do love and serve you truly, as they themselves avow."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right tenderly began he to look on Kriemhild now.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" For ever will I serve you ! " declared the warrior,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Henceforth my head I'll never lay down to rest before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your least wish be accomplished, if life be granted me ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All this, my lady Kriemhild, for your dear sake shall be."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, for the space of twelve days, on each new dawning day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One saw the lovely maiden beside the knight alway.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As often as to court she before her friends must go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the knight this service did her great love allow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All kinds of mirth and pleasure, and mighty noise withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were seen and heard forthcoming daily from Gunther's hall, —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without, and inside also, — from many a gallant man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Ortwein and Sir Hagen right wondrous feats began.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whatever games were started these jocund heroes were</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always among the foremost, a skilled and ready pair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby these warriors soon were well known to every guest ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of such kind were the jewels that Gunther's land possessed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Those who had long lain wounded one saw, at last, appear :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They too would share the pastimes, would fence and throw the spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the king's retainers ; well-pleased to find at length</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they could do as others; they had renewed their strength.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The host would have them treated well, at his festal board.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Theirs was to be the best food. Thus managed he to ward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slightest breath of scandal, which oft a king doth reach.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From guest to guest on went he, with kindly words for each.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He said : "All ye, good warriors, before ye ride away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pray ye take my presents : 'twas in my mind alway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To recompense your service ; my goods despise not ye :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I fain would share them with you ; this do I willingly."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then did the lords of Denmark thus answer, out of hand :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" Before we ride hence, homewards unto our fatherland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We fain would have a treaty : of peace we knights have need.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We've lost dear friends in plenty who, through your knights, lie dead."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Ludegast of Denmark was healed now of his wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eke the Saxon leader was once more whole and sound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Albeit many dead men they left in alien land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then went the royal Gunther to where Siegfried did stand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And to the warrior spake he : " Advise what I shall do ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For early on the morrow our foes intend to go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crave abiding pledges of peace, from mine and me :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now counsel me, thane Siegfried, what seemeth good to thee ?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" What ransom they have offered thou shalt be truly told :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So much as mares five hundred can carry of pure gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This will they give me gladly, if I will set them free."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Siegfried answered stoutly • " That would unworthy be !</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Free, and without a ransom hence shouldst thou let them fare :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that these noble warriors henceforward may beware</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How they come hither, riding as foemen to our land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of this in full assurance let both kings give their hand."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" This counsel will I follow ! " So saying, forth they went.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A message to the foemen was soon thereafter sent :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>" The gold, that ye have offered, doth no man care to keep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While for the strife-worn warriors at home their dear ones weep."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then many a shield with treasure piled high they carried there :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enough, although he weighed not, for every friend to share ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Five hundred marks well-counted, yea more, he gave to some.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This counsel to King Gunther had from bold Gemot come.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then took they leave, for all were impatient to be gone ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But first, before Kriemhilda the guests filed, one by one ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There sat dame Ute also, the Queen, who bade " God speed " I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never before were warriors sped half so well, indeed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The hostels were left empty when they had ridden away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only at home remained the king, in state array</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all his friends and kinsmen, — full many a noble knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These, day by day, were gladden 'd, by dame Kriemhilda's sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now Siegfried, the good hero, did also sue for leave :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not hoping more to win her, to whom his heart did cleave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The king o'erheard the saying that he would fain away :</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Twas Giselher who urged him his journey to delay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>" Now whither, noble Siegfried, is it thy will to ride ?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stay rather, I beseech thee, and with our warriors bide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remain with our King Gunther, and with his men and me ; —</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are there not here fair women, whom thou hast leave to see ? "</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the stalwart Siegfried : **So bide the steeds in stall!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I have changed my purpose, I will not ride at all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bear the bucklers hence too ; — I hoped to see my land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Giselher's true friendship I know not to withstand."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus did the gallant hero remain for friendship's sake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in no other country could he a sojourn make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That to his soul were sweeter ; — and so it hap'd that he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On every day thenceforward did fair Kriemhilda see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For her surpassing beauty he was content to stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spend the days in pastimes, which whiled the hours away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although her love constrained him, it gave him grievous pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through it the brave knight, later, was miserably slain.</span>
