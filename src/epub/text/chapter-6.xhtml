			<h2>Adventure VI.— HOW GUNTHER WENT TO ICELAND AFTER BRUNHILDA</h2>
			<p>
				<span><span>Fresh rumours now were coming from over Rhine: for there</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>As all the folk were saying was many a maiden fair.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of these was good King Gunther now thinking one to woo,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And high his knightly ardour rose, as this purpose grew.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>There was a great queen, dwelling, somewhere beyond the sea,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whose like none had seen ever, and ne'er again would see.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>She was of matchless beauty, and strong withal of make;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>She shot with ready warriors, and made her love the stake.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>A stone she hurl'd far from her, then after it would spring;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He, who her love did covet, must, without wavering,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Win three games in succession from her, the highborn maid;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And if he failed in any, his head was forfeited.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Thus many a time and often the maid was wont to do.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>'Twas one day heard in Rhineland, by a good knight and true.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Who turned his thoughts towards her, and sought to win the dame,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Through whom full many a hero to death foredoomed came.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Upspake the Lord of Rhineland: " I'll go down to the sea,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And visit this Brunhilda, howe'er it fare with me!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For love of her I'm ready to venture limb and life:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I am content to lose them if she be not my wife."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" From that would I dissuade you! " in answer Siegfried said,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" In sooth this queen hath customs so terrible and dread,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That whosoever woos her must pay a price too high;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Seek not to take this journey, I counsel earnestly! "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Now I would fain advise you," thus Hagen to him spake, -</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" To bid Siegfried go with you, and half the burden take,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And share your risk and danger; I counsel this in faith.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Since he such good acquaintance with Brunhild's customs hath."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Quoth Gunther: " Wilt thou help me in very truth, Siegfried,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To woo and win this fair one? ah, if thou dost indeed</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Get her for my betrothed, my own, my noble wife,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then, for thy sake, I'll venture mine honour and my life! "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>For answer gave him Siegfried, the royal Siegmund's son:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Giv'st thou to me thy sister, behold, it shall be done!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Give me the lovely Kriemhild, the high and noble queen;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>No guerdon for my labour, save this I care to win."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" That swear I to thee, Siegfried," cried Gunther " on thine hand!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And if the fair Brunhilda doth come here to this land,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I'll give my sister to thee, to have and hold for wife:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So mayst thou, with thy fair one, aye lead a joyous life."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>By solemn oath they swore it, the noble warriors twain.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But they had toilsome labour, and grief enough, and pain.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Before the high-bom lady home to the Rhine they brought.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The gallant knights' achievement must be with sorrow wrought.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Siegfried his hood of darkness, Tarnhelm yclept, must take:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The same that the bold hero, after hard fight, did make</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>His own, from a dwarf wrested, whose name was Alberich.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The bold and mighty warriors sped on their journey quick.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Whene'er the gallant Siegfried the wondrous Tarnhelm wore,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>A hidden strength was in him he had not known before:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He had the strength of twelve men, joined to his own, 'twas said;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And cunningly he plotted to win the noble maid.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Now this same hood was fashion'd in such a wondrous way</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That any man who wore it could carry out straightway</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whatever thing he wanted, whilst no man could him see.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Therewith he won Brunhilda; whence mickle woe had he.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Now answer me," thane Siegfried, " ere yet our way begin,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>How shall we, with due honour, across the water win?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Should we not take our warriors unto Brunhilda's land?—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Full thirty thousand have I, who soon may be to hand."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" How many folk soever we take there," Siegfried said,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" This queen doth cherish customs so terrible and dread.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That they will all fall victims to her o'erweening mood.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I'll give thee better counsel, thou fearless knight and good.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Let us, as plain knights-errant, go sailing down the Rhine.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And I will name unto thee the knights we'll take of thine.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Besides us two, two others shall go, none else at all:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So shall we win the lady, whatever may befall.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" I one of these four comrades, another shall be thou;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The third had best be Hagen, we should do well enow.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And let the fourth be Dankwart, he hath a dauntless hand;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>A thousand others dare not in fight us four withstand."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>I would I had some knowledge," the king said,—" verily,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Ere we from hither journey, 'twould much enhearten me,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In what apparel should we before Brunhild appear;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>What would be right and fitting? that, Siegfried, would I hear."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>"Whatever be most handsome is worn, I understand,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>By ev'ry man, at all times, in Queen Brunhilda's land;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Therefore should we go finely before this haughty dame,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That when men talk about us we need not blush for shame."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then cried the good king, " Surely, I will myself go ask</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>My own dear, gracious mother, that she do set the task</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To her fair maids, to make us such garb, wherein array'd</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>We may appear with honour before the royal maid."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then Hagen, knight of Tronje, in courtly fashion spake:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Why trouble you your mother with things to undertake?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Let your fair sister hear now all that you have in mind.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Her aid, in this state journey, you will of service find."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>So sent he to his sister; saying, he fain would see</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Her face, as would Sir Siegfried. But, long ere this, had she</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Put on her goodHest raiment; and stood, so fair a maid,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I trow that at their coming she was not much dismay'd!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Also her court-attendants array'd were as was meet</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>When princes twain were coming; and as she heard their feet,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Straight from her chair upstanding right modestly she went</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To greet the noble comers with fitting compliment.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Right welcome is my brother, and his companion eke;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But fain would I have knowledge," thus did the maiden speak,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" What is your lordships' pleasure that ye at court appear?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With you two noble warriors how stands it? let me hear."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then spake King Gunther: "Lady, to you the truth I'll tell:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Although we have high courage, yet have we cares as well.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For we would go a-courting, far in a foreign land,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And now, unto this journey, fine raiment would command."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" So sit you down, dear brother," bade the king's daughter fair.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" And who may be the ladies, for I would rightly hear,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whom you would go a- wooing in other ruler's land? "</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>These favour'd knights the lady did take now by the hand.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>And with them straight returned to where she sat afore.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Rich mattresses, I doubt not were spread upon the floor.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With pictures fair embroidered, set off with golden thread.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then must they with the ladies a pleasant time have had.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>And friendly mutual glances, and looks that were not loth,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Caused many a thought to waken within the hearts of both.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He in his heart aye bore her, dear as his very life;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And soon, by steadfast service, he won her for his wife.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The rich king spake unto her: " O dearest sister mine.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>This thing that we have purposed fails without help of thine.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In Queen Brunhilda's country some pleasure we desire;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And need, in ladies' presence, the goodliest attire."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then did the maiden answer: " Beloved brother mine,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Ready am I, at all times, to serve, in need of thine;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of that thou mayst be certain: it is Kriemhilda's part.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Should any one deny thee 'twould vex her to the heart.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Nor shouldst thou, noble hero, beg of me anxiously,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Thou shouldst command my service, in lordly style and free.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For whatsoever please thee, for that I'm ready aye,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And gladly will I do it; " the maiden sweet did say.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" 'Tis our desire, dear sister, in goodly garb to stand,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Which you may help provide us, with your own noble hand:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So set your women working, that all may be well done,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For we about this journey will be gainsaid by none."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then spake again the maiden: '' Now mark what I shall say!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I have the silk already: see that we get, straightway,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Some gems from off your bucklers: we'll work them on the cloth."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then Gunther and Sir Siegfried obeyed her, nothing loth.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" And who may be the comrades," inquired the royal maid,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>"Who shall to court go with you, thus gorgeously arrayed? "</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" I and three more," he answered, " and two my men will be,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Sir Dankwart and Sir Hagen;— these go to court with me.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" And mark you well, dear lady, and list to what I say!—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>We four companions must have enough for four days' stay.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Three shifts of clothing daily, of good stuff all of it,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That we Brunhilda's country without disgrace may quit."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>With kind farewells the heroes soon after did depart.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then, of her maidens, thirty, well skilled in needle-art,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Did the young queen Kriemhilda call from their room, in haste;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>These all for such-like labours had wit beyond the rest!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Arabian samite was there, white as new-fallen snow,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And Zazemang silks also,—so green doth clover grow,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whereon they wrought the jewels; fine clothes, in sooth, they were;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The peerless maid, Kriemhilda, herself the cloth did shear.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Of foreign fish-skin made they the linings, good and rare,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For stranger-folk to stare at,—as many as there were;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And these with silk were covered, as then the mode did hold.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>There might be many a marvel of this bright raiment told.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>From far Morocco's borders, and from the Libyan shore,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The very choicest samite, that e'er enriched the store</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of any king soever,—this had they, and to spare.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Right plainly showed Kriemhilda to whom she kindness bare!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Since they on this state journey determined to set forth,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Plain ermine furs they reckoned of insufficient worth.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So over them fur trimmings of coal-black hue they set:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>On high-days such like garments brave knights right well befit.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Amidst Arabian gold-work there glittered many a gem.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So careful were the women, naught was too small for them.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In seven weeks the raiment was all prepared aright,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And eke the weapons thereto for every gallant knight.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>When this was all made ready, upon the banks of Rhine</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Was diligently fashion'd a little vessel, fine</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And strong, which down the river should bear them to the sea.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The noble maids by this time were of their tasks weary.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>'Twas told unto the warriors that all things were to hand</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That they were to take with them;— all their apparel grand,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Such as they had desired; it all was now complete:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So would they on the Rhine-bank no longer stay their feet.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Therefore, to fetch their comrades, a messenger was bade,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That they should come and look on this raiment newly made;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>It might be, for the heroes, too long, or else too small.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But 'twas of the right measure: they thanked the ladies all.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>For all who came and saw it were bounden to confess,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In all the world they never had seen more noble dress.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They might be proud such clothing in any court to wear;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of finer knights' apparel, in sooth, knew no one there.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Thanks manifold and hearty their judgment did receive.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And then these joyous warriors desired to take their leave;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>This did the noble comrades with knightly courtesy.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Bright eyes were then, with weeping, all sad and watery.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>She said: " My dearest brother, you still have time to stay,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And woo some other woman, 'twould be the better way.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>You would not then endanger your body and your life:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Here might you find, much nearer, as highly-born a wife! "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Her heart, I ween, foreboded what, later, did befall:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>As ev'ry word was spoken they fell to weeping all.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The gold upon their bosoms was tarnished with the tears</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Which rained from their eyelids, by reason of their fears.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Again she spake: " Sir Siegfried, let me commend, I pray,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Unto your truth and kindness, my brother dear alway;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That no mischance befall him in Queen Brunhilda's land."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The gallant hero swore it, upon Kriemhilda's hand.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The mighty thane thus answered: " So long as I shall live,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>You, to his safety, lady, no anxious thought need give;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I safe and sound will bring him home to the Rhine; " he said,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" That know now of a surety." The fair maid bow'd her head.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Their gilded shields were carried straight down unto the shore,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And to the ship was taken of clothing their whole store;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They bade men bring their horses, they hasted to be gone.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then was by beauteous women much bitter weeping done.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>There, standing, at the windows, was many a lovely child;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>A high wind fair was blowing—the ship's sail soon was fiU'd.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The gallant band of heroes on Rhine were floating free;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then spake the royal Gunther: " Who now shall skipper be? "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" That will I be! " cried Siegfried, " for I can down the flood</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Right well and safely steer you, doubt not, ye heroes good;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The proper water-channels, I well do understand."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then joyously they parted from the Burgundian land.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Sir Siegfried took a boathook, and stoutly did it grip,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And, leaning on it strongly, from strand he shoved the ship;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The mighty man. King Gunther, did likewise seize an oar.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And soon these worthy heroes had cleared them from the shore.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>They carried costly viands, and plenty of good wine,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The best that had been vintaged upon the banks of Rhine.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Their horses stood right firmly,—they had a well-found stall ;■ -</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Their vessel voyaged smoothly; small ill did them befall.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then they unfurl'd the sailcloths,—the stout sails, strained and tight,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And twenty miles they sailed, or ever it was night.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With a good wind to help them down stream, toward the sea.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Their steadfast toil was later those brave ones' woe to be.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Upon the twelfth day morning, as we have heard men say.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The wind had borne the vessel far distant, and away</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Toward Isenstein the fortress, in Queen Brunhilda's land:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To all of them, save Siegfried, it was an unknown strand.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Now, when the royal Gunther so many towers did see,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And eke so wide a marchland, he spake, all suddenly:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Tell me, my good friend Siegfried, if it be known to thee,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whose are these many castles, and this fair land we see? "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then answered Siegfried: " Truly it is to me well known:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>This people and this country doth Queen Brunhilda own,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And Isenstein's her fortress, as you have heard me say;—</span></span>
				<br/>
