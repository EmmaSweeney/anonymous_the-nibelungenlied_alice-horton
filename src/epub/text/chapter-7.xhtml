			<h2>Adventure VII.— HOW GUNTHER WON BRUNHILDA.</h2>

389. 
Now, while all this was passing, their ship had neared unto 
The castle walls, so closely that the king's eyes could view 
Above them, at the windows, full many a winsome maid. 
That he knew none amongst them made Gunther passing sad. 

390- 
Then questioned he Sir Siegfried, his brave companion : 
" Of all those lovely maidens, dost thou in truth know none, 
Who now are gazing downward at us upon the flood ? 
Whoe'er their lord and master, they be of noble blood.'* 

391- 
To him replied Sir Siegfried : " Now look you, secretly, 
Amidst the maids there standing, and then confess to me 
Which you would take among them, if you thereto had might." 
"That will I do!" cried Gunther, the bold and valiant knight. 

392- 

" Yonder, within that window, I see one of them stand 
All in a snow-white garment ; she's fairest of the band ! 
'Tis her mine eyes have chosen, so fair she is to see: 
Had I the power to wed her, my wife she needs must be." 

393. 
" The judgment of thine eyesight hath done for thee right well ! 
That is the noble Brunhild, the maiden beautiful, 
Whom all thine heart desireth, thy senses, and thy mood." 
In all ways did her bearing seem to King Gunther good.

394- 
The queen her beauteous maidens did thereupon command 
To leave the windows straightway : they ought not there to stand, 
A gazing-stock for strangers ! they readily obey'd. 
And what the ladies next did hath since to us been said : 

395- 
They decked themselves for sake of the visitors unknown, 
As comely women ever since days of old have done. 
Then to the narrow windows they quickly came again, 
Whence they could see the heroes, — and gazed with might and 



396. 

There were of them four only, who came unto the land. 
Bold Siegfried now was leading a horse along the sand ; 
The comely dames beheld him, across the window shelf: 
Whilst Gunther thought with pride that they gazed upon himself. 

397- 
He held it by the bridle, — the shapely animal, 
It was so sleek and handsome, so big and strong withal, — 
Until the king had mounted, and in the saddle sat. 
Thus Siegfried did him service ; which he erelong forgat. 

398. 
Then Siegfried fetched his own steed, which in the ship did stay; 
Such service had he rendered but seldom till that day, 
To stand at a man's stirrup, until he was astride ! 
The fair and noble ladies this from their lattice spied. 

399- 
These two high-mettled heroes — to one ensample clad — 
White chargers and white raiment like snow new-fallen had, 
Each matching with the other ; their solid bucklers bright 
Shone, on the left hand hanging of either goodly knight.

400. 
Bejeweird were their saddles, their saddle-bows were small j 
So rode they in their glory, before Brunhilda's hall. 
The bells upon their harness were wrought of bright red gold. 
They came unto that country as bound on venture bold. 

401. 
With spear-heads newly sharpened, with swords well-wrought and 

keen, 
Which hung down to the rowels of these two goodly men ; 
Such weapons bore the bold ones, with broad and sharp-edged 

blade. 
'Twas all marked by Brunhilda, the great and noble maid. 

402. 
With them came also Dankwart, and Hagen of Tronj^. 
These warriors were apparell'd, as ancient legends say, 
Alike, in costly raiment and raven-black of hue ; 
Fair were their shields and mighty, and strong and broad thereto. 

403- 
The jewels that adorned them from India's land were brought. 
And glittered on their garments, as these the sunshine caught. 
Their little vessel left they unguarded, on the flood ; 
So rode they to the castle, these heroes brave and good. 

404. 
Full six-and-eighty turrets they saw within the wall. 
Three palaces far-stretching, and one fair, well-built hall, 
Compact of precious marble, as meadow-grass all green ; 
And here, amid her court-folk, awaited them the queen. 

405- 
The castle gate unlocked was, the doors were open thrown, 
Brunhilda's liegemen hasted to meet these guests unknown, 
To welcome these newcomers unto their lady's land ; 
They bade men take their horses and bucklers from their hand. 



70 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

406. 
A chamberlain said to them : " Yield now your swords to us, 
And eke your shining hauberks." ** Nay, it shall not be thus ! " 
Cried Hagen, lord of Tronjd, " These we ourselves will bear ! " 
Then Siegfried had to teach him what were the customs there. 

407. 
" The fashion in this castle, as you must understand, 
Is that no guest shall carry a weapon in his hand. 
So let them hence be taken : in sooth, 'tis fairly meant." 
Then Hagen, Gunther's liegeman, did grudgingly consent. 

408. 
Wine for the guests was order'd, and lodgings good prepared. 
And to and from the palace swift-footed warriors fared, — 
All clad in princely raiment they ever came and went ; 
And on the stranger-heroes were wond'ring glances bent. 

409. 
Then unto Queen Brunhilda some one the news declared, 
That certain unknown warriors had suddenly appear'd, 
In glorious apparel, by ship across the flood. 
Whereon began to question the maiden fair and good. 

410. 
" I would that someone told me," so spake the maiden queen, 
Who are these stranger-warriors, that ne'er afore were seen. 
And now stand in my castle, with such a noble grace ? 
And for whose sake these heroes have voyaged to this place ? " 

411. 
Then spake one of her people : " Lady, I must avow 
Not one of these same warriors I e'er beheld till now ; 
But there is one among them much like unto Siegfried : 
You must give him good welcome, that is in sooth my rede.

412. 
"The other his companion, who is so praiseworthy, 
If he the power had, either some rich king he might be, 
Or have the jurisdiction o'er some wide princely lands : 
One sees beside the others how royally he stands. 

413- 
" The third of these companions he is of aspect grim. 
Yet, mighty Queen, right comely he seems, and fair of limb ; 
From those his rapid glances that he around him throws. 
His mien, if I mistake not, a gruesome temper shows. 

414. 
" The youngest knight among them seems worthy of all praise ; 
As gentle as a maiden, yet knightly are his ways. 
How winsomely he stands there, with what a high-born mien ! 
And yet, if he were thwarted, we'd rue the hour, I ween. 

415- 
•• How blithe soe'er his bearing, and beautiful his form. 
There's many a goodly woman — an' he began to storm — 
That he could bring to weeping ; his body fashion'd is 
To excel in manly virtues, — a brave, bold thane is this !" 

4160 
Then spake the queen: "Nowbringme my raiment and my gear; — 
And if the mighty Siegfried to win my love is here. 
And therefore to this land comes, — 'tis like to cost his life ! 
In sooth, I do not fear him enough to be his wife." 

417. 
Ere long, the fair Brunhilda was fittingly array'd. 
With her there came full many a beauteous serving-maid, — 
A hundred, perhaps, or over, — attired in all their best. 
These comely dames were eager to see the stranger-guest. 



^2 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

418. 
With these there went, in order, the thanes of Isenland, 
The warriors of Brunhilda, each with his sword in hand. 
Five hundred men, or over ; whereat their hearts misgave. 
Then from their seats uprose they, the heroes bold and brave. 

419. 
When first the Queen Brunhilda perceived the knight Siegfried, 
Ye would, perchance, be told of the words the maiden said : 
" Be welcome," quoth she, " Siegfried, here unto this our land. 
What meaning hath your journey I fain would understand?" 

420. 
** I proffer, dame Brunhilda, my hearty thankfulness, 
That you have deigned to greet me, most generous princess, 
Before this noble warrior, who stands beside me now ; — 
Seeing that he my lord is, such grace I disavow ! 

421. 
" By birth he is of Rhineland ; and what shall I say more ? 
His love for thee 'tis only that brings us to this shore. 
My lord doth seek to wed thee, whatever may befall ; 
Of this, in time, bethink thee : he will not change at all. 

422. 
" The name he bears is Gunther, he is a mighty king. 
If haply he may win thee, he asks no other thing. 
'Twas this good warrior bade me upon this journey come : 
An' I had dared deny him, I'd fain have stay'd at home." 

423- 
She spake : " Since he's thy master, and thou his vassal art, 
I'll stake a venture with him, if he dare play his part, 
And if he gain the mast'ry, then will I be his wife ; 
But should I be the winner, ye all do risk your life." 



VII.] HOW GUNTHER WON BRUNHILDA. 73 

424. 
Then Hagen spake, of Tronje : " O lady, let us see 
This mighty game you play at ; before a victory 
You score off my lord Gunther, it will go hard enow ! 
For such a beauteous maiden he'll count to win, I trow/' 

425- 
" The stone he must throw boldly, then leap to where it lies ; 
Then hurl the javelin with me : so be ye not unwise ! 
Who knows ? each may be losing his honour and his head ! 
You must bethink you therefore," the winsome fair one said. 

426. 
On this, the gallant Siegfried unto King Gunther went, 
And bade him tell the princess his purpose and intent ; 
He might be for the issue without anxiety : 
" I shall be there to shield you with all my craft," quoth he. 

427. 
Then spake the royal Gunther : " Most high and mighty queen ! 
Declare your task unto me ; and had it harder been, 
For sake of your fair body I everything would stake : 
My very head I'd venture you for my wife to take." 

428. 
As soon as Queen Brunhilda his will and meaning knew, 
She bade the games be hastened, as seemed to her but due. 
And ordered them to bring her her wonted gear for fight, 
A ruddy golden breastplate, and buckler round and bright. 

429. 
A silken fighting-doublet drew over all the maid, 
Such as, in closest combat, would turn the sharpest blade ; 
Of Lybian stuff 'twas woven, and it was deftly done; 
A bright embroider'd trimming upon the border shone. 



74 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

43°- 
Meantime the stranger-warriors were eyed somewhat askance, 
And Dankwart and Sir Hagen ill brooked this arrogance. 
And how the king would fare, too, did weigh upon their mood. 
They thought : " unto us warriors our journey bodes no good." 

431. 
The while these things were doing, Siegfried, the crafty one, 
Had, unperceived of any, back to the vessel gone. 
And found his hood of darkness, where hidden it had lain, 
And swiftly slipped it on him : thus he became unseen. 

432- 
Then back again he hastened to where the queen he found 
Her fateful game arranging, with many knights around. 
Invisibly he joined them : so cunningly 'twas done 
That, midst the whole assembly, he was discerned by none. 

433- 
The ring was marked out clearly wherein the games should be ; 
In presence of bold warriors, who came the sport to see. 
Seven hundred men and over one saw, who weapons bare : 
Which of the two was winner the heroes must declare. 

434. 
Ere long appeared Brunhilda in all her warlike gear. 
As if she meant to conquer all kingdoms far and near. 
Above her silken vestment was twisted golden twine : 
One saw thereunder ever her lovely colour shine. 

435- 
And then came her attendants ; who in their hands did hold 
A mighty round-rimmed buckler, all wrought of ruddy gold. 
With steel-like clasps upon it, many, and broad, and bright ; 
And underneath its shelter the lovely maid would fight. 



VII.] HOW GUNTHER WON BRUNHILDA. 75 

436- 
The maiden's shield-sustainer a noble baldrick was, 
Wherein were gems embroidered, as green as e'er was grass ; 
Their ever-changing brightness was mirror'd in the gold. 
He who would win such lady must needs be warrior bold ! 

437- 
Her shield beneath the bosses, as we have heard declare, 
Was three good spans in thickness ; and this the maid could bear. 
With steel and gold inlayings so richly 'twas beset, 
Her chamberlains — four of them — could scarcely carry it. 

438. 
When now the sturdy Hagen beheld this shield brought in, 
The wrathful Lord of Tronje did thus to speak begin : 
" How now. King Gunther ? truly we're like to lose our life, 
She, whom you would be wooing, must be the devil's wife ! " 

439- 
Hear more now of her raiment : she had a wondrous store, 
A warrior's silken mantle from Azagaug she wore, — 
A noble, costly garment ; from which the flash was seen, 
Of many a splendid jewel pertaining to the queen. 

440. 
Then bore they to the lady, — and weighty 'twas, I trow, — 
A giant-spear well sharpened, which she was wont to throw ; 
Most strong and monstrous was it, and mighty too, and broad, 
And with its keen twin-edges right terribly it gored. 

441. 
Of that spear's weight, now hearken and hear the wonderment : 
Four and a half good measures of metal to it went. 
Three of Brunhilda's liegemen could scarce uphold its weight. 
When noble Gunther saw it, his courage did abate 



76 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

442. 
And in his heart he pondered : " What e'er will be the end ? 
If she be a hell-devil, who can the matter mend ? 
Were I alive and safely once more in Burgundy, 
Here, rid of love and wooing, she long might wait for me ! " 

443- 
Then outspake Hagen's brother, the valiant Dankwart, 
"Alack that we did ever on this state-journey start ! 
But knights we still are, surely, and it were very shame 
To perish in this country, o'ermastered by a dame. 

444. 
" I do regret right sorely that e'er I saw this land ! 
Had but my brother Hagen his weapon in his hand, 
And I had mine ! methinketh they'd be a whit more mild, 
With all their pride and boasting, these vassals of Brunhild. 

445- 
" For, know now of a surety, each one of you I warn, 
No oath of peace should bind me, — had I a thousand sworn. 
Ere I fordone before me my master dear shall see, 
This maid her life shall forfeit, how ever fair she be ! " 

446. 
" We, without let or hindrance, could surely leave this land," 
Said Hagen, Dankwart's brother, " had we good swords in hand, 
And eke the armour on us that we in battle need ; 
Then would this haughty woman soon change her tone indeed!" 

447. 
Full well the noble maiden heard what the warrior said ; 
With smiling mouth, half-turning, she o'er her shoulder bade : 
" Thinks he himself so valiant ? bring them their armour then, 
And let these heroes handle their keen-edged swords again." 



VII.] HOW GUNTHER WON BRUNHILDA. 77 

448. 
When they received their weapons, at the proud maid's command, 
For joy did Dankwart redden to hold his sword in hand : 
"Now play your games, and welcome !" shouted thefearless thane, 
Gunther need fear no danger, we have our swords again ! " 

449. 
The strength of Queen Brunhilda it was a fearsome thing ; 
They brought her for the contest a stone into the ring — 
A monstrous one and heavy, so mighty, and so round, 
Twelve stalwart heroes scarcely could heave it from the ground. 

450- 
Whene'er she threw the javelin she next would hurl this stone. 
Then did the stout Burgundians within their spirit groan : 
" God help us ! " cried Sir Hagen, " what bride our king hath 

woo'd ! 
Hell were her proper sojourn, she's of the Devil's brood ! " 

451. 

Around her snow-white arms she began her sleeves to wind, 
And on her hand she fastened the buckler to her mind ; 
Then high she poised her javelin ; and so began the fight. 
Gunther, and Siegfried likewise, did dread Brunhilda's spite. 

452. 
And were it not for Siegfried, who came unto his aid. 
The king's life had been forfeit unto the doughty maid. 
The knight, unseen, approach'd him, and twitch'd him by the 

hand; 
But Gunther quail'd : his cunning he did not understand. 

453. 
" What was it that did touch me ? " the bold man thought, and he 
Look'd round and sought on all sides, but not a soul could see. 
A voice said : " It is Siegfried, 'tis I, your trusty friend, 
As to this queen, I pray you, let fear be at an end.'* 



78 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

454. 
He said : " Unhand the buckler, and let me carry it, 
And what thou hear'st me tell thee, mark well with all thy wit : 
Thine must be all the gestures, but I will do each deed." 
When Gunther understood him his heart grew light indeed. 

455- 
" See thou conceal my cunning, and tell no man thereof : 
The queen will little glory win from thee, though she scoff, 
And though it be her purpose to add unto her fame: 
See how she stands before thee, fearless, the noble dame ! *' 

456- 
With all her strength of body, her spear the glorious maid 
Against a new shield hurled, — 'twas broad and stoutly made, — 
Which on his arm was bearing the son of Siegelind ; 
Bright fire-sparks from the steel flew, as driven by the wind. 

457. 
The blade of her stout lance-head clean through his shield did 

crash, 
And from his close-ring'd hauberk the fire was seen to flash. 
The shock of the encounter so drave the stalwart men. 
That, saving for the Tarnhelm, they both had there been slain 

458. 
Out of the mouth of Siegfried, the bold knight, gushed the blood ; 
But soon again upsprang he : then gripped the hero good 
The spear which she had hurled, that thro' his buckler went, 
And back it flew upon her, by Siegfried's strong hand sent. 

459- 
He thought : " I will not shoot her, this maid who is so fair ! " 
And so he turned behind him the sharp head of the spear, 
And with the shaft he smote her upon her vest of steel ; 
So that the blow re-echoed that his stout hand did deal 



VII.] HOW GUNTHER WON BRUNHILDA. 79 

460. 
The fire broke from her armour, as driven by the wind ; 
Hard were the spear-thrusts dealt by the son of Siegelind ! 
So much King Gunther never had done with his own hand. 
With all her strength, the maiden such blows could not withstand. 

461. 

The beauteous Brunhilda, how soon she up did bound ! 
" I thank thee, noble Gunther, thy shot its mark hath found ! " 
She thought that he had done it by his own strength alone ; — 
But no, there slipt behind him a far more mighty one. 

462. 
Away she sped full swiftly, and wrathful was her mood ; 
The stone aloft she lifted — this noble maid and good — 
Then from her hand she hurled it with all her might and main, 
And after it she leapt while her armour rang again. 

463. 
Thestone fell twelve good arms' lengths beyond her standing-place ; 
But further yet the maid sprang, and cleared the stone a pace. 
Then came the noble Siegfried to where the stone did lie : 
'Twas Gunther that did lift it, 'twas Siegfried let it fly. 

464. 
So bold a man was Siegfried, so mighty and so tall, 
He threw the stone still further, and leapt beyond its fall. 
His subtle arts had given such wondrous power of limb. 
That, in the leap. King Gunther, he bore along with him. 

465. 
Thus was the leaping over, and hurling of the stone ; 
And they who looked saw no one, save Gunther there alone. 
The beauteous Brunhilda all red with wrath became : 
For Siegfried had prevented King Gunther's death and shame. 



8o THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

466. 
Unto her court-folk turning, she loudly spake, as she, 
Across the ring, the hero all safe and sound did see : 
"Come hither, quick, my kinsmen, and my good lieges all, 
Ye must now to King Gunther be underlings and thrall ! " 

467. 
Then laid these stalwart warriors their weapons from their hand 
At Gunther's feet, the rich king from the Burgundian land ; 
Then bent to do him homage full many a dauntless knight ; — 
They thought that he the contest had won by his own might. 

468. 
He gave her gentle greeting, for he was courtly bred. 
Then by the hand she took him, that famous maid, and said : 
She would henceforth allow him the rule and power to hold. 
Right glad thereat was Hagen, the warrior brave and bold. 

469. 
She bade the noble hero along with her to go 
Into the wide-room'd palace ; which being done also, 
More fittingly was service paid to the noble knight. 
Dankwart and Hagen glad were to see such pleasant sight 

470. 
Meanwhile, the ready Siegfried wisely his plans did lay : 
He took the hood of darkness and hid it safe away. 
Then the great hall he entered, where many ladies sat, 
And fell to question Gunther, and artfully did that : 

471. 
" Wherefore, my lord, delay you ? when doth the game begin 
At which the queen so often hath challenged you to win ? 
Let us behold and quickly in what wise it is done ! " 
As though he knew naught of it behaved the crafty one.

472. 

"How can it e'er have happened," thereon inquired the queen, 
"That you, most noble Siegfried, naught of the game have seen, 
Wherein I have been worsted by mighty Gunther's hand ? " 
Then answered her Sir Hagen of the Burgundian land. 

473- 
He spake : " Yourself, O lady, did much disturb our mood ; 
So to the ship departed Siegfried, the hero good, 
What time our lord of Rhineland did win the game from you : 
Therefore he knows naught of it," said Gunther's liegeman true. 

474. 
" Now welcome are these tidings," quoth warrior Siegfried, 
" That thus your pride hath fallen doth please me well, indeed, 
That some one there is living who may your master be ! 
Now must you, noble maiden, go with us o'er the sea." 

475. 
Then spake the noble fair one : " This may not yet befall : 
My kinsmen first must hear it, and my good liegemen all ; 
I may not thus so lightly desert my land, I trow ; 
My chief friends must be sent there, ere I myself shall go." 

476. 
Then sent she heralds riding here, there and everywhere, 
To bid her friends and kinsmen, and lieges all repair 
To Isenstein the fortress, nor would she take excuse ; 
And bade that costly raiment be given for their use. 

477- 
So daily came they riding, from early hours till late 
Unto Brunhilda's castle, like to an army great. 
" Now, by my faith ! " cried Hagen, " see now what we have done '. 
With fair Brunhilda's liegemen we'll trouble have anon.

" While thus in power and numbers they throng throughout the 

land, 
What is the queen's intention we cannot understand : 
What if she be against us so wroth that we be lost ? 
The noble maiden surely was born to our great cost ! '* 

479- 
Then spake the sturdy Siegfried : " All this will I forestall ; 
The danger you are dreading I will not let befall. 
I must go hence, and succour bring quickly to this shore, — 
A band of chosen warriors ne'er known to you before. 

480. 
"Ye must not seek to find me, I go across the sea ; 
May God meanwhile preserve you from all indignity ! 
I'll come back quickly, bringing a thousand men with me, 
The very best of warriors that ever one could see." 

481. 
" Be not too long gone from us," the king in answer said : 
" In this our need we shall be right glad to have your aid." 
Said he : " I'll come back to you, ere many days be spent ; 
And you must tell the queen that by you I have been sent."
