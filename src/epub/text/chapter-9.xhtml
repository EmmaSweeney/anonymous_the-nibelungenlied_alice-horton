			<h2>Adventure IX.— HOW SIEGFRIED WAS SENT TO WORMS</h2>
			<p>
				<span><span>When they nine days had travel'd upon their homeward way,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Spake Hagen, lord of Tronje: " Now hark to what I say!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>We yet have sent no tidings to Worms upon the Rhine:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Your heralds should be, surely, in Burgundy long syne."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>King Gunther made him answer: " Lo, what you say is right,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And for this errand, surely there is no better knight</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Than you yourself, friend Hagen; so ride now to my land:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Our journey no one better can make them understand."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Whereto made answer Hagen: " Small use should I be there!—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Let me look to the cabin, whilst on the flood we fare:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>ril stay beside the women, and to their gear attend,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Until we bring them safely into Burgundian land.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Bid Siegfried rather do it, and him your envoy make;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>His mighty strength will aid him, the task to overtake.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Should he decHne the going, you must, with kindliness.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For love of your fair sister, the journey on him press."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>He sent to fetch the warrior, who came at his command.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Quoth Gunther: "Since we're nearing our home in mine own land,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I ought to send a message unto my sister dear,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And eke unto my mother, that we the Rhine draw near.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" This ask I of thee, Siegfried j the favour grant, I pray,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That I may ever thank thee," the warrior good did say.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But Siegfried did withstand him,—he was so bold a man!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Until King Gunther sorely to plead with him began.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" To ride thou shouldst be willing, for my sake," Gunther said,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>"And likewise for Kriemhilda's, the beautiful young maid \—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That we may owe thee service, the noble maid and I."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>When Siegfried heard that saying he could no more deny.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Whate'er thou wilt command me, I cannot say thee nay!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For love of that fair maiden I'll do what thou dost say.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>How could I aught deny her, who owns my heart alone?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For her sake that thou askest is all as good as done."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Go then and tell my mother, Ute, the noble queen,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That we anent this journey in joyous mood have been;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And let the kings, my brothers, know each how we did fare;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And all our friends must also the happy tidings hear.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" And from my beauteous sister, I pray thee naught reserve;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>But say that I and Brunhild will her right gladly serve.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And tell unto the court-folk and all my serving-men,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That what my heart had yearn'd for, full well did I attain!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>"And tell to gallant Ortwein, that nephew dear of mine,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That he have seats erected by Worms upon the Rhine.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And all my other kinsmen, they also should be told</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That I, with Queen Brunhilda, high festival will hold.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>"And tell unto my sister (as soon as she hath learn'd</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>How, with my guests so shortly I shall be home return'd)</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That she to my betroth'd one a welcome good must give :—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So shall I to Kriemhilda for aye beholden live."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then did the noble Siegfried a courteous farewell</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Take of the Lady Brunhild, as did beseem him well,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And of her courtiers likewise; then to the Rhine rode he.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>No m essenger were better in all the world than he.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>With four and twenty horsemen he into Worms did ride.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Without the king he cometh! " was heard on every side;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And all the folk lamented, and stirr'd were with the dread</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Lest in that foreign country they'd left their master dead!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>They from their steeds dismounted: right happy was their mood;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And Giselher hastened to them, the youthful king and good,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And eke his brother Gemot: how eagerly spake he,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>When he the kingly Gunther did not with Siegfried see!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Be welcome, Siegfried," cried he, " but, pray you let me know</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Where you have left my brother, who forth with you did go?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>If Queen Brunhilda's prowess have robbed us of our king,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Methinks your high-aim'd wooing hath been an evil thing! "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Forego your fears!" quoth Siegfried, " my noble comrade sends</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>His loyal love and greeting to you and all his friends.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In rare good health I left him: I came at his command</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To bring you, as his envoy, tidings to this your land.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" You must see to it quickly, however it may be,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That I the good queen-mother and your fair sister see;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For they must hear the message, which I was bade to tell,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>From Gunther and Brunhilda: with both of whom 'tis well."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then Giselher the lad said: " Go then to her you've won,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Since for my sister's favour, such service you have done!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Great trouble doth she suffer about my brother's fate.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The maid will see you gladly, I'll warrant me of that!"</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The noble Siegfried answer'd: " An I can serve the maid,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Right faithfully and gladly that service shall be paid.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Now who will tell these ladies that them I fain would see? "</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Twas Giselher the comely his messenger would be.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Swift Giselher the tidings unto his mother told,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And eke unto his sister, when he did them behold:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" To us the hero Siegfried of Netherland hath come;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Him hath my brother Gunther here to the Rhine sent home.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" He bringeth us full tidings of how the king doth fare.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Now must ye give permission that he to court repair;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>From Iceland brings he hither a true report, I trow."—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Yet soon these noble ladies much sorrow were to know.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>To get their robes they hasten'd, and did themselves array;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And then they summon'd Siegfried to come to court straightway,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Which did he, willing-hearted, too happy her to see:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The noble maid Kriemhilda spake to him graciously.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" Be welcome, my lord Siegfried, thou worthy knight!" she cried;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Where doth my brother Gunther, the noble king, abide?</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Of him, by Brunhild's prowess, I ween we are forlorn 1</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>O woe is me, poor maiden, that ever I was born! "</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then spake the gallant hero: " Now pay me herald's fee I</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For know, O beauteous ladies, no need to weep have ye.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In lusty health I left him, of that ye may be sure;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To tell you both these tidings he sent me on before.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" They send to you their duty,—he and that bride of his,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With all true love and kindness, most noble queen; it is</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>High time to leave off weeping,—for they will soon be here! "</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For many a day she had not heard tidings half so dear.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then with her snow-white kerchief she wiped her lovely eyes</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That were all wet with weeping; and in her gracious wise</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Began to thank the bearer for the good news he brought.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And so her grief and sorrow were turn'd to pleasant thought.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>She bade him to be seated, whereof right glad was he.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Then spake the lovesome maiden: " Rejoiced should I be,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Could I for herald's guerdon give all my gold away!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Too rich for such meed are you,—I'll be your debtor aye."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Said he: " If for my portion I thirty kingdoms had,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>I would, by your hands given, of any gift be glad! "</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Well! " said the gracious lady, " it shall be given to you."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Her chamberlain was bidden to fetch the herald's due.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Full four-and-twenty buckles, set with bright stones and good,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>She gave him for his guerdon. And yet the hero's mood</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Allowed him not to keep them;— he handed them around</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Unto her nearest ladies that in the room he found.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Her mother gave him greeting, in kind and courtly way.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" I have yet more to tell you," the valiant man did say,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>" Of what the king requireth when to the Rhine comes he;—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>If, lady, you will grant it, he'll aye beholden be.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>" The noble guests he bringeth—I heard him this desire—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>He wishes you to welcome; and eke he doth require</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That you ride forth to meet him, outside Worms, on the strand;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>This doth the king, at your hands, in all good faith demand."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then spake the lovely lady: " Ready am I alway</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Howe'er I can to serve him; I cannot say him nay;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>All shall in loyal kindness, as he desires, be done."</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whereat her cheek, for gladness, a heighten'd colour won.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>No prince's herald ever a better welcome had;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And had she dared to kiss him she would have been right glad.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>How winsomely the gallant then from the dames withdrew!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>As noble Siegfried counsel'd did the Burgundians do.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Sir Sindold and Sir Hunold, and eke Rumold the thane,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To whom the charge was given, must work with might and main</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>To have the seats made ready, by Worms upon the sands,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>One saw the royal stewards there working with their hands!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Ortwein and Gere would not that aught be left undone.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They sent unto their kinsfolk on all sides, every one;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>They told them of the wedding which was about to be.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The beauteous maids adorn'd them for the festivity.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The palace was made splendid, and deck'd was ev'ry wdl</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>In honour of the guest-folk. King Gunther's royal hall</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Was all right well upholstered by many a foreign man.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And so this mighty wedding right merrily began.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then all along the highways throughout the countryside</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Were seen the three kings' kinsmen, who bidden were to ride</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And wait the guests' arrival, who soon were to appear.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>While from the stores was taken abundance of rich gear.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Erelong was spread the rumour that certain folk had seen</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Brunhilda's friends approaching; at which there did begin</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Great stir among the people in the Burgundian land.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Ay me! what gallant warriors were seen on either hand!</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then spake the fair Kriemhilda: " Ye maids attending me,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Who would at this reception fain bear me company,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Go, seek from out my presses the richest robes and best:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>That thereby praise and honour we gain from every guest."</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The warriors came shortly,—who ordered to be brought</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The saddles nobly-fashioned, with finest gold inwrought,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>On which should ride the ladies, at Worms upon the Rhine.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>One never saw horse-trappings more fitting or more fine.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Ha! what a golden gleaming from these gay palfreys shone,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And how the bridles sparkled with many a precious stone!</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The footstools eke were golden, on carpets bright and good</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Placed for the ladies' mounting: right joyous was their mood.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The women's mares were saddled, and in the court did stay</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>For the young maids of honour,—as I erewhile did say.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Small saddle-bows and silken one saw these palfreys bear:</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The finest silk, I warrant, of which you e'er could hear.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Then six-and-eighty matrons out of the palace went,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And on their heads were wimples. Towards Kriemhilda bent</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Each beauteous dame her footsteps, in garments bright array'd;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And no less well apparell'd, came many a comely maid.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>In number four-and-fifty, damsels of Burgundy,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The best they were and fairest that ever eye could see;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>One saw their flaxen tresses, with bands of riband bright.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>What Gunther had desired was done with zeal aright.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>The richest stuffs then wore they, the best one e'er could find,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Before the stranger- warriors; good clothes of many a kind,—</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>So that each sev'ral beauty might have a setting fit.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Whoso were discontented must be of little wit.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>Of sable and of ermine was many a costume there,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And many an arm, and hand too, were made to seem more fair</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>With buckles and with bracelets on the silk stuffs they wore.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Should any try to tell you, his task would ne'er be o'er.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>With many a fine- wrought girdle—so rich, and long, and gay,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Hanging o'er shining raiment—the women's hands did play.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Their skirts of Ferrandine were, and stuff of Araby.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Among those noble maidens was gladsomeness and glee.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>In stomacher bejewell'd was many a maiden fair</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Most winsomely enlaced. And sad indeed it were</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>Did not her bright complexion outshine her dress in hue.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>No other king had ever so fair a retinue.</span></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><span>As now those lovely ladies in full attire were seen,</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>The knights who should escort them appear'd upon the scene.</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>High-couraged warriors were they, of mighty strength and craft;</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span><span>And each, beside his buckler, did bear an ashen shaft.</span></span>
