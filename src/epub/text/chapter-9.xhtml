			<h2>Adventure IX.— HOW SIEGFRIED WAS SENT TO WORMS.</h2>

529- 
When they nine days had travel'd upon their homeward way, 
Spake Hagen, lord of Tronje : " Now hark to what I say ! 
We yet have sent no tidings to Worms upon the Rhine : 
Your heralds should be, surely, in Burgundy long syne."

530. 
King Gunther made him answer : " Lo, what you say is right, 
And for this errand, surely there is no better knight 
Than you yourself, friend Hagen ; so ride now to my land : 
Our journey no one better can make them understand." 

531- 
Whereto made answer Hagen : " Small use should I be there ! — 
Let me look to the cabin, whilst on the flood we fare : 
ril stay beside the women, and to their gear attend, 
Until we bring them safely into Burgundian land. 

532- 
" Bid Siegfried rather do it, and him your envoy make ; — 
His mighty strength will aid him, the task to overtake. 
Should he decHne the going, you must, with kindliness. 
For love of your fair sister, the journey on him press." 

533- 

He sent to fetch the warrior, who came at his command. 
Quoth Gunther: "Since we're nearing our home in mine own land, 
I ought to send a message unto my sister dear, 
And eke unto my mother, that we the Rhine draw near. 

534. 

" This ask I of thee, Siegfried j the favour grant, I pray, 
That I may ever thank thee," the warrior good did say. 
But Siegfried did withstand him, — he was so bold a man ! 
Until King Gunther sorely to plead with him began. 

535- 
" To ride thou shouldst be willing, for my sake," Gunther said, 
"And likewise for Kriemhilda's, the beautiful young maid \ — 
That we may owe thee service, the noble maid and I." 
When Siegfried heard that saying he could no more deny.

536. 
" Whate'er thou wilt command me, I cannot say thee nay ! 
For love of that fair maiden I'll do what thou dost say. 
How could I aught deny her, who owns my heart alone ? 
For her sake that thou askest is all as good as done." 

537- 
" Go then and tell my mother, Ute, the noble queen, 
That we anent this journey in joyous mood have been ; 
And let the kings, my brothers, know each how we did fare ; 
And all our friends must also the happy tidings hear. 

538. 
" And from my beauteous sister, I pray thee naught reserve ; 
But say that I and Brunhild will her right gladly serve. 
And tell unto the court-folk and all my serving-men, 
That what my heart had yearn'd for, full well did I attain ! 

539- 

"And tell to gallant Ortwein, that nephew dear of mine, 
That he have seats erected by Worms upon the Rhine. 
And all my other kinsmen, they also should be told 
That I, with Queen Brunhilda, high festival will hold. 

540. 
"And tell unto my sister (as soon as she hath learn'd 
How, with my guests so shortly I shall be home return'd) 
That she to my betroth'd one a welcome good must give : — 
So shall I to Kriemhilda for aye beholden live." 

541- 
Then did the noble Siegfried a courteous farewell 
Take of the Lady Brunhild, as did beseem him well, — 
And of her courtiers likewise ; then to the Rhine rode he. 
No m essenger were better in all the world than he. 



IX.] HOW SIEGFRIED WAS SENT TO WORMS. 93 

542. 
With four and twenty horsemen he into Worms did ride. 
*' Without the king he cometh ! " was heard on every side ; 
And all the folk lamented, and stirr'd were with the dread 
Lest in that foreign country they'd left their master dead ! 

543- 
They from their steeds dismounted: right happy was their mood; 
And Giselher hastened to them, the youthful king and good, 
And eke his brother Gemot : how eagerly spake he, 
When he the kingly Gunther did not with Siegfried see ! 

544- 
" Be welcome, Siegfried," cried he, " but, pray you let me know 
Where you have left my brother, who forth with you did go ? 
If Queen Brunhilda's prowess have robbed us of our king, 
Methinks your high-aim'd wooing hath been an evil thing ! " 

545- 
" Forego your fears !" quoth Siegfried, " my noble comrade sends 
His loyal love and greeting to you and all his friends. 
In rare good health I left him : I came at his command 
To bring you, as his envoy, tidings to this your land. 

546. 
" You must see to it quickly, however it may be, 
That I the good queen-mother and your fair sister see ; — 
For they must hear the message, which I was bade to tell, 
From Gunther and Brunhilda : with both of whom 'tis well." 

547. 
Then Giselher the lad said : " Go then to her you've won, 
Since for my sister's favour, such service you have done ! 
Great trouble doth she suffer about my brother's fate. 
The maid will see you gladly, I'll warrant me of that !" 



94 THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

548. 
The noble Siegfried answer'd : " An I can serve the maid, 
Right faithfully and gladly that service shall be paid. 
Now who will tell these ladies that them I fain would see ? " 
Twas Giselher the comely his messenger would be. 

549- 
Swift Giselher the tidings unto his mother told, 
And eke unto his sister, when he did them behold : 
*' To us the hero Siegfried of Netherland hath come ; 
Him hath my brother Gunther here to the Rhine sent home. 

550- 
" He bringeth us full tidings of how the king doth fare. 
Now must ye give permission that he to court repair ; 
From Iceland brings he hither a true report, I trow." — 
Yet soon these noble ladies much sorrow were to know. 

551- 

To get their robes they hasten'd, and did themselves array ; 
And then they summon'd Siegfried to come to court straightway, — 
Which did he, willing-hearted, too happy her to see : 
The noble maid Kriemhilda spake to him graciously. 

552- 
" Be welcome, my lord Siegfried, thou worthy knight !" she cried ; 
" Where doth my brother Gunther, the noble king, abide ? 
Of him, by Brunhild's prowess, I ween we are forlorn 1 
O woe is me, poor maiden, that ever I was born ! " 

553- 
Then spake the gallant hero : " Now pay me herald's fee I 
For know, O beauteous ladies, no need to weep have ye. 
In lusty health I left him, of that ye may be sure ; — 
To tell you both these tidings he sent me on before. 



IX.] HOW SIEGFRIED WAS SENT TO WORMS. 95 

554. 
" They send to you their duty, — he and that bride of his, — 
With all true love and kindness, most noble queen ; it is 
High time to leave off weeping, — for they will soon be here ! " 
For many a day she had not heard tidings half so dear. 

555- 
Then with her snow-white kerchief she wiped her lovely eyes 
That were all wet with weeping ; and in her gracious wise 
Began to thank the bearer for the good news he brought. 
And so her grief and sorrow were turn'd to pleasant thought. 

556. 
She bade him to be seated, whereof right glad was he. 
Then spake the lovesome maiden : " Rejoiced should I be, 
Could I for herald's guerdon give all my gold away ! 
Too rich for such meed are you, — I'll be your debtor aye.'* 

557- 
Said he : " If for my portion I thirty kingdoms had, 
I would, by your hands given, of any gift be glad ! " 
" Well ! " said the gracious lady, " it shall be given to you." 
Her chamberlain was bidden to fetch the herald's due. 

558. 

Full four-and-twenty buckles, set with bright stones and good, 
She gave him for his guerdon. And yet the hero's mood 
Allowed him not to keep them ; — he handed them around 
Unto her nearest ladies that in the room he found. 



559; 

Her mother gave him greeting, in kind and courtly way. 
" I have yet more to tell you," the valiant man did say, 
" Of what the king requireth when to the Rhine comes he ; — 
If, lady, you will grant it, he'll aye beholden be. 



9^ THE LAY OF THE NIBELUNGS. [ADV. 

560. 
" The noble guests he bringeth — I heard him this desire — 
He wishes you to welcome ; and eke he doth require 
That you ride forth to meet him, outside Worms, on the strand; 
This doth the king, at your hands, in all good faith demand." 

561. 
Then spake the lovely lady : " Ready am I alway 
Howe'er I can to serve him ; I cannot say him nay ; 
All shall in loyal kindness, as he desires, be done." 
Whereat her cheek, for gladness, a heighten'd colour won. 

562. 
No prince's herald ever a better welcome had ; 
And had she dared to kiss him she would have been right glad. 
How winsomely the gallant then from the dames withdrew ! 
As noble Siegfried counsel'd did the Burgundians do. 

563. 
Sir Sindold and Sir Hunold, and eke Rumold the thane, 
To whom the charge was given, must work with might and main 
To have the seats made ready, by Worms upon the sands, 
One saw the royal stewards there working with their hands ! 

564- 
Ortwein and Gere would not that aught be left undone. 
They sent unto their kinsfolk on all sides, every one ; 
They told them of the wedding which was about to be. 
The beauteous maids adorn'd them for the festivity. 

565. 
The palace was made splendid, and deck'd was ev'ry wdl 
In honour of the guest-folk. King Gunther's royal hall 
Was all right well upholstered by many a foreign man. 
And so this mighty wedding right merrily began. 



IX.] HOW SIEGFRIED WAS SENT TO WORMS. 97 

566. 
Then all along the highways throughout the countryside 
Were seen the three kings' kinsmen, who bidden were to ride 
And wait the guests' arrival, who soon were to appear. 
While from the stores was taken abundance of rich gear. 

567- 

Erelong was spread the rumour that certain folk had seen 
Brunhilda's friends approaching ; at which there did begin 
Great stir among the people in the Burgundian land. 
Ay me ! what gallant warriors were seen on either hand ! 

568. 
Then spake the fair Kriemhilda : " Ye maids attending me, 
Who would at this reception fain bear me company, 
Go, seek from out my presses the richest robes and best : 
That thereby praise and honour we gain from every guest." 

569- 
The warriors came shortly, — who ordered to be brought 
The saddles nobly-fashioned, with finest gold inwrought, 
On which should ride the ladies, at Worms upon the Rhine. 
One never saw horse-trappings more fitting or more fine. 

570- 
Ha ! what a golden gleaming from these gay palfreys shone, 
And how the bridles sparkled with many a precious stone ! 
The footstools eke were golden, on carpets bright and good 
Placed for the ladies' mounting : right joyous was their mood. 

571. 
The women's mares were saddled, and in the court did stay 
For the young maids of honour, — as I erewhile did say. 
Small saddle-bows and silken one saw these palfreys bear : 
The finest silk, I warrant, of which you e'er could hear.

572- 
Then six-and-eighty matrons out of the palace went, 
And on their heads were wimples. Towards Kriemhilda bent 
Each beauteous dame her footsteps, in garments bright array'd ; 
And no less well apparell'd, came many a comely maid. 

573. 
In number four-and-fifty, damsels of Burgundy, 
The best they were and fairest that ever eye could see ; 
One saw their flaxen tresses, with bands of riband bright. 
What Gunther had desired was done with zeal aright. 

574. 
The richest stuffs then wore they, the best one e'er could find, 
Before the stranger- warriors ; good clothes of many a kind, — 
So that each sev'ral beauty might have a setting fit. 
Whoso were discontented must be of little wit. 

575. 
Of sable and of ermine was many a costume there, 
And many an arm, and hand too, were made to seem more fair 
With buckles and with bracelets on the silk stuffs they wore. 
Should any try to tell you, his task would ne'er be o'er. 

576. 
With many a fine- wrought girdle — so rich, and long, and gay, 
Hanging o'er shining raiment — the women's hands did play. 
Their skirts of Ferrandine were, and stuff of Araby. 
Among those noble maidens was gladsomeness and glee. 

577- 
In stomacher bejewell'd was many a maiden fair 
Most winsomely enlaced. And sad indeed it were 
Did not her bright complexion outshine her dress in hue. 
No other king had ever so fair a retinue. 



X.] HOW BRUNHILDA WAS RECEIVED AT WORMS. 99 

578. 
As now those lovely ladies in full attire were seen, 
The knights who should escort them appear'd upon the scene. 
High-couraged warriors were they, of mighty strength and craft ; 
And each, beside his buckler, did bear an ashen shaft.
